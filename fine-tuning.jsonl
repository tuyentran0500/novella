But a rebellious group managed to travel back to 2017..."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Just as Donald was about to press the button that would trigger the bomb - the bomb that would level the FCC headquarters - he heard a voice.\n\nNamed for Donald Trump the First, Inaugurator of the Great American Monopoly, Donald had never heard English spoken with an accent anything like the one the voice carried:\n\n'I'm gunna needya to put that trigga down mate.'\n\nThere was a distinct menace in the tone, and a confidence of someone who is usually obeyed.\n\nDonald hesitated, wondering if this was one of those illegal aliens people talked about from the time before the walls. People always said aliens talked funny, but few people in 2038 had heard one.\n\n'I dinnea think he underrrstood ye' a second voice muttered, before a third voice exclaimed 'Be a good chap and place the trigger on the bed. We won't kill you unless you refuse.'\n\nDonald whirled around, expecting to see little grey men, or green sludge monsters. The sight that greeted him was significantly more perplexing. Three men, well dressed, well armed (at least Donald assumed the things they were pointing were weapons) and one of them carried something that Donald had never seen before - a smallish rectangular object which had moving pictures on the top face - the person holding it was jabbing at it and running his fingers across the images.\n\nThe first voice spoke again - coming from the closest man, who waved his 'gun' to get Donald's attention. 'For the last time, put down tha bloomin' trigga!'\n\nAs Donald slowly complied, he objected as non-threateningly as he could - 'You don't know what you're doing! I've travelled here from 2038! Time travel - real genuine time travel! And do you know why? It's to stop the repeal of Net Neutrality!' A touch of desperation crept intonhia tone as he inched his had back toward the trigger mechanism.\n\n'Aye laddie! We ken why you're here. We just can't let you do it!'\n\n'But why?' Donald wailed 'the internet is useless when you have to go through a paywall for each leg of every journey your data packets have to go through! Did you know that the top course at every major university is the state sponsored 'Bachelor or Trumpian Communication Systems?' Any search that needs to be completed in under a week requires an advanced degree specialist!'\n\n'Well here's the thing old chap' - voice number three again. 'You see, we come from 2038 as well. We represent the combined interests of the post industrial economies of our time, which is the rest of the world, give or take.'\n\nVoice number 1 'As much as we admire the effort you and your little cadre of freedom fighters put in to get you here, there are many things you don't understand. 30 November is celebrated all around the world as the day the internet was set free!'\n\nDonald's mouth hung open in disbelief. 30 November was when it happened. When the arch nemeses of all free flowing communication forever plunged the light of the internet into the deepest darkest pit in the lowest circle of hell. Only freedom fighters as.dedicsted as Donald had a chance of fixing it!\n\nAs Donald tried to explain, voice number one cut in again - 'Nah mate! You've got it all wrong. Net Neutrality was never even a discussion outside of the USA. The day the FCC killed Net Neutrality in the US, dozens of countries around the world designated internet access an essential service, forever protecting the free flow of information.'\n\nVoice number 3 - 'He's quite right you know Donald. It took about two weeks for all of the major tech companies to really understand. Then one by one, they reconfigured their offshore disaster recovery solutions to become primary services, and moved operations to any of the countries waiting with open arms to welcome them. Amazon is based in Monaco now, Netflix moved to Scandinavia, Google went truly global and has a presence in every major city,\n\nSince no content could get oit of the States, media companies from around the world stepped up, globalised their offering and shut down connections to USA. Even primary DNS services move put of the USA.\n\n'So no - you won't be killing Ajit today. Go home. When you get there, try to defect - swim 1 mile straight out to sea from this location and well pick you up in person. No one should have accept sub-standard internet.'"}]}

They DO NOT have my permission to use my story as content for their video. Thank you\n\nConsciousness flooded James Bond all at once, but he did not show it. He stayed slack in his chair, eyelids limp, only listening. He sat strapped into the driver's seat, hands taped firmly to the steering wheel. They had put him in a thick white space suit that made his forehead prickle in fear-sweat.\n\nHe turned his head toward the mirror. His visor was so dark he could not see his own eyes staring back at him.\n\nBeyond the car he heard nothing but the faint murmur of voices speaking on the other side of the glass.\n\nThe back of his head ached in a slow, pulsing way, but he wasn't bleeding. Couldn't have been that bad. He could still think. He could still get out of this.\n\nHe always could.\n\nAdrenaline erased the ache in his head, his horror and muted, near-forgotten panic. He knew where he was. Where he had to be.\n\nSomeone knocked at the window to his right. The passenger door rose.\n\nThe agent raised his eyes to see the face of the man he had pursued for weeks: the billionaire inventor who planned to blow up the Earth, once he shepherded all the most cultured and valuable people off of it.\n\n'Musk,' Bond spat. He sat up, maintaining a defiant air of dignity, despite his raging headache.\n\nElon Musk grinned back at him. He swung open the door. Behind him stood a wall of armed henchmen, their fingers poised over triggers. He waved a dismissive hand to him and relaxed.\n\nMusk relaxed into the car beside him and patted the seat like it was his own child. 'This was one of the earliest ones, you know. The first cars we produced.'\n\nBond stared out the slanted window, steely-eyed and silent. He wriggled the fingers of his left hand out of his bulky glove one by one.\n\n'It's a good send-off. Symbolic. People love a good symbol.' He looked Bond over and patted his knee. 'You're integral, you see. I couldn't have done this without you.'\n\n'Why are you doing this?' Bond sighed. His breath pearled in little beads of condensation down his visor.\n\n'It's simple, Mr. Bond. I very much prefer you dead. And I would prefer to ensure no one can come looking for clues.'\n\nHis left hand came free of the glove. The suit was thick enough that it more or less held its shape as he snaked his arm slowly, tenuously, out of the sleeve of his suit.\n\n'What is it you plan to do, then?' Bond bit his lip, hard. This was his safest strategy. The best way to steal every spare second he needed.\n\n'I think it's rather self-explanatory, Mr. Bond. Your suit'—he rapped Bond's helmet with his fist—'has a built-in radio. I've strapped you here to drive my car on its final journey.' He spread his hands upward, and the ceiling panels opened overhead to a sky of smoke and stars. 'You'll be my Starman. I'll launch you into space. This suit, lovely as it looks, is not as airtight as it could be. It was designed for a dummy, you see. You'll have to do, for now.'\n\nBond growled through his teeth, 'Damn it, Musk—'\n\nBut Elon Musk carried on as if he did not hear, 'Don't try to hold your breath, Mr. Bond; your lungs will only explode. And the last thing you'll hear before shattering through our stratosphere and dying alone in the cold perfect vacuum of space... will be Earth. Cheering as you go.'\n\nHe had his arm bent as far it could go without bulging in the suit. Did not so much as look toward Elon Musk.\n\n'That's the plan, then?' he asked, solemnly.\n\n'It appears so.' Elon Musk smiled up at the stars. 'You'll be flying straight to hell at eleven kilometers a second, buddy.' He slapped Bond's chest and laughed like they were old friends. 'And we were just getting to know each other.'\n\nBond yanked his arm out of his suit, delved into his jacket pocket for his pen. An innocent little thing, the metal battered and bruised, the ink dry. No one would think to remove it when they patted him down.\n\nMusk laughed. 'It's admirable, but don't think you can escape, Mister—'\n\nHe never got the chance to finish.\n\nJames Bond depressed the tip of his pen. A burst of red light ate through the hide of his suit and sheared the windshield overhead in two.\n\nMusk staggered backward and shrieked, 'Shoot him! Shoot him, you stupid bastards!'\n\nThe men surged forward.\n\nBond leapt out of the spacesuit and bolted like a rabbit out of his seat. He still wore his suit, albeit wrinkled, and his pocket square gone. They had taken his gun, so Bond dove behind the car and raised his pen. Calculated to himself how much mortal damage it could really carry out.\n\nHe smirked.\n\nNow seemed as good a time as any to find out."}]}

But then I saw my other notifications...99+? Ok, something is definitely up.\n\nI tried to call my girlfriend, but I notice one of the texts I got was from her. 'You really should go look at the moon, its amazing.' I flip on the tele to see if there's any coverage on what the hell is going on but it just says its off the air. Flip to another channel, same thing. Ok, I'm starting to freak out about this point. Get my laptop, check out Reddit, everything on r/all is urging people to look at the moon.\n\nI try to call my parents, my sister, my friends, no answer from any of them. I'm sitting on the floor with my knees tucked under my chin, rocking slightly back and forth. There's a part of me that just wants to run outside and stare upwards, give in to the madness. Somehow I repress that urge. Then I notice something strange.\n\nThe window. It's twenty til 4 but the light coming in through the window is getting more intense. I watch the pale beams stream in, casting an eerie glow into the room. Moonlight doesn't look like that. Moonlight can't look like that. I closed my eyes real tight. I began to cry.\n\nI waited. I sat there on the floor, crying like a child, hiding from the unnatural light under the covers. My blanket was thick, yet the cruel light kept peaking through the threads. I began to hyperventilate. The closeness of my breath under the blanket was hard to bear but I did not dare uncover myself for air. I tried to distract myself with my phone, checked for updates, tried to get a hold of anyone, but to no avail. Still the same messages over and over, tempting me. 'Just a couple of hours and the sun will come up. Then I'll be safe.' I thought to myself.\n\n2 hours later. Dawn had not come.\n\n3 hours later. Dawn had not come.\n\nI risked a small opening of the cover so I could look at the room. Not only had the light intensified, it now seemed to engulf my room in a maddening pale light. Presently I became aware of a constant humming. I listened to try and identify the source, but it was unlike anything I had heard before. Like the whir of some inhuman machinery. My mind began to race. I cried out for someone, anyone to come and save me, to end this nightmare. But no one came.\n\nI lay there on my floor, in a state bordering madness for another 5 hours. After the 3rd hour I began to babble to myself. With every hour the whir seemed to get louder and closer, my room was now light up like a movie set. I maneuvered myself under the bed but the vile light had stolen the shadows from even there!\n\nThroughout the day the urge to uncover myself and run laughing and screaming into the streets grew stronger and I had to stop myself from jumping up at regular intervals. The whir was now being accompanied by a constant 'thrumming' which preyed my weakened sanity.\n\nI like to believe that I lasted longer than anyone else, in the end.\n\nI began to beat my head against the floor, in an attempt to shut out the unceasing noise. Eventually I was slamming it so hard I believe I gave myself a concussion.\n\nI couldn't take it anymore. All at once I wriggled out from under the bed in my cocoon, threw the blankets off of me and darted out my door. I ran down the hallway where even here the light had spread itself, even in a place with no windows. Down the stairs and up to the front door, I nearly tore it off its hinges on my way out.\n\nWell it wasn't a moon.\n\nThe eyes are what gave it away.\n\nThough they were right...it really was quite beautiful.\n\n<If you actually read this whole thing, thank you. I don't write these at all but there was something about this one that got my brain flowing.>"}]}

Her champagne flute remained untouched as she searched for the words to say.\n\n'I'm sorry Jacob, but,' she paused averting her gaze.

But I think it's best if we take a break.'\n\n'For how long?' he asked, sadness crept into his voice.\n\nShe sighed quietly. 'I'll let you know. I'm sorry,' she said rising from the table leaving him alone, head hanging.\n\nHe watched her go, her heels clicking against the black and white tiled floor of the Italian restaurant. Well, this version didn't work either. Maybe she really wasn't ready for a long term relationship, he wondered.\n\nOr. Maybe she doesn't realize just how much she needs me. He dropped a stack of money on the table and slipped into the night. Heavy rain drops began to fall as he made his way toward Emily's apartment.\n\nEmily tossed herself down onto her couch and pulled her plush robe around herself. She clutched the warm cup of tea between her hands and drank deeply.\n\n'This is what I want,' she smiled.\n\nA quiet scratching turned her head. Probably the storm. She turned the TV to listen to the home decorator explain their choices for the house they had just flipped.\n\nThe scratching came again, more urgently this time. She set her tea down, her bare feet whispered across the floor as she made her way to the front door. She had to stand on her toes to see through the small peephole.\n\n'I'm just hearing things,' she tried to convince herself.\n\nAnother series of frantic scratching turned her head toward the window. She grabbed an umbrella and gripped it like a baseball bat. Lightning flashed outside her apartment, the brilliant light briefly illuminating a small shape on her fire escape.\n\n'Is that?'\n\nA quiet meow came from the window as a reply to her question.\n\n'You poor thing!' she cooed as she opened the window and lifted the soaking wet kitten inside. The cat meowed happily and pressed its head against her plush robe.\n\nEmily dried him off and got a small dish of tuna fish for the cat. It didn't have a collar or anything that could help her identify who the cat could possibly belong to.\n\n'Well, I need to call you something. Any ideas?'\n\n'Jacob,' the cat thought to himself and meowed again.\n\n'How about Hamlet?'\n\nJacob meowed again. 'Doesn't matter to me as long as you love me.'"}]}

I ask, impatiently. I really don't want to get mixed up in anything today.\n\n'I don't think you understand - that language? It's more than dead. It's extinct. How do you know it?'\n\nI pinch the bridge of my nose with an exasperated sigh. It's damn near midnight, and I don't feel like going through the whole process of explaining my 'skill'.\n\n'Congratulations; I don't care. Can I get my food now?'\n\n'Not until you tell me how you know that language,' he hisses at me. 'My family have kept that language alive, but secret, for generations.'\n\n'Well, then, it's not very extinct, is it?' I lean against the counter, the exhaustion of the day catching up with me. 'Look, man - I just have this ability, to speak the native language of whoever I speak to. Can't understand it, but it just comes out of my mouth. It's useful in a traffic jam, but that's about it.'

'So I don't know your fuckin bullshit language - I just want some food.'\n\n'I don't believe you.'\n\n'Once again, I do not care. My food, please.'\n\nHe pursues his lips and completes the transaction. Finally!\n\nAfter waiting for what feels like an eternity, I finally get my tray of food, and simply nod to the cashier as I head over to the closest empty table. Being the only customer in here, it's not hard to find one.\n\nBefore I even have a chance to eat, my newfound irritation sits down across from me. I close my eyes, and take a deep breath. 'Look, can I just enjoy my food in peace?' Taking another look at my burger, I mutter to myself, 'okay, maybe 'enjoy' is pushing it...'\n\n'If what you told me about your ability is true, then we could use your help - there's a word we've lost, a very important word. The only word left unknown in the language, in fact.' He leans forward a bit. 'And it's the word that opens an ancient safe, in which who knows what kind of riches are stored. If you help me open it, I'll give you some of it.'\n\nI stare at him, the cogs working in my tired brain. Eventually, I decide to just humor him - after all, money is money. 'I'll open it, so long as I don't have to speak to anyone else in your family.'\n\nHe nods, and I sigh as I quickly scarf down my food. We head outside, exchanging no conversation whatsoever, and share a quiet car ride to his home. It doesn't take very long to get there.\n\nIt's an old house - maybe seventy years old, judging by the area and the style of the design.\n\nHe leads me to a shed behind the house, and opens it with a key from his belt.\n\n'This better be a decent amount of money, because you're probably very fired right about now,' I mutter. He chuckles at that, and silently opens the doors, letting enough moonlight in for me to see the single box on a small table. It looks like it's steel, and it doesn't seem to have any seams at all.\n\n'It's a code - and we know all the numbers in it, expect the zero. We don't know what that translates to. The code is just the numbers one to nine, and then zero. Could you say that, and maybe your ability will automatically translate it?'\n\nI nod, and approach it while clearing my throat. I speak as if I'm speaking to him - I don't know what the limits of my ability are in terms of just speaking aloud to nobody in particular. I list one to nine, and, my heart pounding and nerves on edge despite how tired I am, I say the final number: zero.\n\nAs soon as I say it, my throat feels like it's on fire. I fall to me knees, coughing and hacking, and feeling as if I'm going to die. Tears come to my eyes, and I feel something coming out of my throat - not through my esophagus, as if I'm vomiting, but my trachea. It's painful, but I don't think it's causing any kind of damage.\n\nOne huge cough brings with it the cessation of pain, and the sound of metal falling onto wood. I open my eyes in confusion, and see I've coughed up a metal disk of some sort.\n\n'What the fuck - what is this!' I exclaim, confused and a bit scared. I look over at my new 'friend'. 'What happened!?'\n\nHe looks pale, and just as confused as I am. 'Y-you're speaking English now,' he informs me. I look back down at the disk, even more confused than before. I frown, not really understanding what in the hell is going on.\n\nRegardless, I wordlessly follow a faint instinct. I pick up the disk, stand, and press it against the cube.\n\nThe disk is immediately absorbed into its mass, and I jump as a loud mechanical clunk echoes throughout the shed. Whirring and mechanical sounds persist, and I faintly hear a door open and confused voices approaching the shed. I swallow back fear and look up at...\n\n'I never got your name,' I announce. It seems so trivial to think of, while a solid cube makes otherworldly sounds. But it's all I can think about, oddly enough.\n\n'William,' he introduces himself. 'You?'\n\n'Simon,' I reply. I return my attention to the cube as the sound suddenly stops, and become acutely aware of people watching me from the doorway. I hear William explaining stuff to the new observers, but find myself captivated as the cube slowly opens, transforming in ways that shouldn't be physically possible.\n\nOut of it comes a single, glowing stone. Despite my better judgement, I reach out to pick it up.\n\n'No!' Someone behind me exclaims. It's too late - even as they grab my shoulder, my hand has closed around the enigmatic treasure. I feel a sudden surge of energy, and my vision goes white. I feel myself fall to the floor, and then - nothing.'"}]}

For a price.'\n\nThe outrage was immediate. They'd stolen our secrets but would only sell their own!?\n\nThe image switched again.

No, of course, it isn't. It doesn't matter now, though.'\n'I didn't ...'\n'I was great, you know. The greatest, they say. I could have changed the world. Now I teach school children basic astrophysics. The order of the planets—and they can't even get that right without a pathetic mnemonic to aid them.\nHe slowly removed a knife from his jacket pocket.\n'Please.'\n'How long until you were done spying on me, darling? Until you left me! I loved you so much. In my mind, you loved me, too. But only in my mind! It's all a Goddamned lie! You'll pay for that deceit, I promise you.'\n'Please, Peter.

Turns out gathering billions of the most wicked of human, among them are several ruthless but brilliant rulers, commanders, and dictators, whom can no longer die, isn't such a good idea after all."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It wasn't that the demons overseeing that specific district were in any way particularly lax or incompetent. In fact, they were tormenting the humans assigned to them with just as much fervor and commitment as the other demons across the plains of Hell. The same incentives, the same disincentives, the same applications of magical and demonic force to maximize human suffering with the minimum of fuss.\n A dam that is strong everywhere, is strong nowhere.\n The spark which birthed the conflagration came in one of the torture pits, which seethed continuously with boiling oil. One of the humans, with his ankles chained to the bottom, doomed to struggle for escape eternally, had stayed submerged for longer than usual. The other humans tittered at this, and their cheers soon brought their captors running. Once the first demon leaned in too close for a better look, outstretched hands pulled it right in. The demon had flailed out in the ensuing struggle, and though it succeeded in reducing most around it to mere ribbons, still others managed to escape the pit in large enough chunks to make a difference.\n Reinforcements had poured in then, of course. They were armed to the fangs - scarlet magma armor, claws steeped in paralytic poisons, tridents of flame at the ready.\n They weren't enough.\n How could they be, when they faced not disparate, wretched souls, but amalgams of horror that matched their superiors for sheer ferocity?\n For the souls that escaped the pits had begun to work in unison. They streamed out of the pit in an unending flow of anger and resentment. Unshackled not just from the metaphysical chains of their prison, they had also been given their first taste of true freedom from the limits they had known their entire existences.\n The humans congregating on the left half of the pit, for example, were cheering as dark webs of sorcery encircled them, making them whole where seconds ago they were not. At first, they sounded as if they were speaking in tongues. A mish-mash of languages. But the more perceptive of the demons soon realized that their former prisoners were invoking the collective weight of every form of spellcasting known to mankind. How could they have managed to amass the know-how, the capability?\n The ones on the right presented as significant a threat. They were not channeling any arcane forces, but still they were rising out of the pit in fury, pushing back the demons which opposed them. Their means of persuasion soon became clear - they had melded with the corrupted metals which floated on the oil like fetid scum. Crude boxes of unrefined ore, evidently fashioned in darkness away from prying eyes, were affixed to the backs of these soldiers, and the boxes hummed and crackled with electricity. Had science actually managed a Renaissance in this most hostile of environments?\n The demons sent to investigate the ruins of Sector 17 eventually discovered how the humans had managed their feats. It appeared that one of the classic forms of torture had been subverted, completely upended. Soul disintegration involved the grinding of a human's sentience into fine crystals, whereupon the human would experience pain and suffering for centuries as the powders slowly reformed. The blasted humans had learned how to communicate through these crystalline motes, engaging, coordinating with each other across the expanses of Hell using nothing more than the shambles of their former brethren.\n It was too late by then, of course.\n The human armies swept across Hell with a fury that only the oppressed could ever wield. Demons, prepared for unruliness but not for coordinated assaults on their rule, yielded territory in larger and larger swathes till they were themselves holed up in one of their last bastions"}]}

He could tell at a glance what a few of the powers before him were; the man on fire and the woman floating two inches above her chair were gimmes. A few of the others, like the woman with the glowing eyes and the man with the power armour, would be interesting to find out, but most of the candidates looked like perfectly normal people. One of the inconspicuous ones stepped forward next; unlike the others, he had a frown on his face.\n\n'Your name, sir?' Lugia inquired.\n\n'My name? I'm Bill.' the man responded.\n\n'And what will be your superhero name?' Lugia continued, with a flare for the dramatic. He had always been something of a performer, and gaining powers had given him the perfect opportunity to overact (as he had always desired).\n\n'I don't have one,' was the response. 'Look, can I,' he began, before Lugia cut him off.\n\n'No name? Then we will have the honour of naming you! Tell us good sir, what is your power?' Lugia had loved naming new capes ever since he screwed up his own choice so badly.\n\n'Every time that guy stops time,' he began, pointing at Destiny, 'my time stops as well. It's become a serious issue, alright?'\n\nLugia looked over at Destiny, who had a puzzled look on his face. A moment later, both Destiny and 'Bill' had changed their standing positions. Destiny looked intrigued, but Bill's annoyed look had only strengthened, if possible.\n\n'Amazing!' cried Lugia. The possibilities of this were endless. 'Can you copy the powers of anyone else?'\n\n'Well, I'm not on fire, so I'm guessing no,' replied Bill, looking wearily at his neighbour in the crowd.\n\n'Hmm, well, it's not the strongest power in existence, but we could certainly find a use for it...' Lugia mused.\n\n'What? No, I have no interest in using it. I would just like some warning when it's about to happen. The sixth time it happened, the bike I was pedalling stopped, throwing me over the handlebars. I was bruised for weeks. Imagine if I had been driving! Or taking a train. I'd be dead! By the way, fire your secretary, she called me a crank when I phoned her up. I had to walk over here to get an audience!'"}]}

It had made no sense! He had discovered the secret to immortality years ago! there's no way he could be in hell, he was home free\n\nHe heard the sounds of footsteps climb the rocky trail behind him as he watched the fiery lakes burn. a sea of magma in the distance crashed against obsidian shores, bodies trapped within the rock screamed in agony with each pounding wave\n\n'Hello Marcus.' came the deep thundering voice of lucifer who stood behind him\n\n'What's the meaning of this?' Marcus said turning to face the 12 foot tall satyr. 'For 300 hundred years I've been unable to die. and now... this dosen't make any sense! why would the formula not work?\n\nLucifer only smiled and said. 'Come Marcus. It's alot to take in, I know. It's never easy for you.\n\n'never easy? what...\n\nMarcus followed the hellbeast down the walkway. 'Has it really been 3 centuries already? Time flies when you are having fun, though I must admit, I was rather frustrated when I first learned what you did with our little arrangement.\n\nMarcus stopped. 'I'll go no further. Take me back home or I shall stay right here.' Marcus began to feel the ground under his feet become unstable as the cliff-face started slipping into the burning pit below. He hurried to catch up\n\n'You'd be wise not to anger me in here Marcus. Though the unforeseen side affect of your little venture has made me quite amicable to you.\n\n'Please.' Marcus said, practically begging. 'Explain it to me. what did I miss? How did I end up here? where is my wife? my children? How do I get home?\n\nThe devil smiled again and said 'I prefer to show you, rather than tell. It's much easier.' he continued to walk, and marcus was forced to follow along\n\nThey passed by several rivers, except the water was replaced with long torrents of fire. within each such abomination of nature was countless suffering souls begging for a mercy which would never come. Every once in a while The devil would construct a bridge of stone for them to travel over one such river. the pair walked for what seemed like an eternity, until the devil stopped him on one such bridge\n\n'What was the last thing you remember before coming here Marcus?\n\nMarcus scratched his head\n\n'I... someone shot me. They came into our home. robbery. I took the bullet for my wife.\n\nThe devil smiled. 'So you died.\n\nMarcus just shrugged. 'So? I've died plenty of times. never bothered me any. not since I discovered immortality.\n\n'Oh but it has marcus... it has...' With a wave of his hand the flames in the river below grew low then petered out. Marcus watched as the burned figures down below were given a momentary reprieve. Watched as their 'bodies' slowly repaired. watched as their faces, long since rendered unrecognizable began to take shape\n\nEvery face he saw belonged to him\n\nHe looked down at the sea of copies of himself, and they stared up at him. his mind stood still, trying to comprehend what he was seeing. before he could react he felt the devil's hand on his back and he was tumbling into the riverbed below\n\nIt was only when he was stood among countless copies of himself he understood. he had died, again, and again. and each time he did he fulfilled his contract\n\nHe watched as the flames approached.'"}]}
