Along the way, she wonders about her identity and whether she has been changed into someone else. Ultimately, she decides that she would rather stay in the world she is in than go back to the real world. The Mouse tells Alice a story, but gets angry and walks away before finishing. Alice and the others beg the Mouse to come back and finish the story, but it refuses. Alice talks to a Lory and a Crab about her pet cat, Dinah. The mention of Dinah's predilection for catching and eating birds causes a stir among the other animals, who all hurry off. Alice is left alone, wondering if she will ever see her cat again. The White Rabbit is looking for his fan and gloves, and Alice tries to help. The Rabbit gets angry and tells Alice to go get them, so she runs off. Alice finds a house with a brass plate that says \"W. Rabbit\" and goes in. She finds a room with a fan and gloves and picks them up. She also finds a bottle and drinks from it. Alice drank from a magic bottle and grew until she was too large for the room. She was uncomfortable and wished she could go home.

The rabbit hole leads her to a strange and fantastical world where she has a series of adventures. She meets peculiar creatures along the way, including the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, and the Queen of Hearts. In the end, Alice wakes up from her dream and realizes it was all just a dream.\n\nStory so far: Alice falls down a rabbit hole and has adventures in a fantastical world. Along the way, she wonders about her identity and whether she has been changed into someone else. Ultimately, she decides that she would rather stay in the fantastical world than go back to the real world. A little animal is scratching and scrambling in the chimney close to Alice. She kicks it, and Bill falls out of the chimney. Alice encounters a group of rabbits who tell her to go away. She then finds herself in a room full of cakes, which she eats, and shrinks. Alice shrinks and runs into a crowd of animals and birds. They all attack her, but she escapes into a thick wood. She then decides her first task is to grow back to her normal size, and the second is to find the garden. While she is peering around, an enormous puppy appears and scares her. She offers it a stick and it jumps away. Alice meets a puppy and plays with it for a while, before realizing that she is too small. She wonders how she will grow up again, and decides she needs to eat or drink something. Alice meets a blue caterpillar smoking a hookah and they have a conversation.

{"prompt": "Outline: Dorian Gray is a young man who is incredibly handsome. He becomes friends with a painter named Basil Hallward, who is completely infatuated with Dorian's beauty and paints a portrait of him. Dorian becomes obsessed with his own beauty and wonders what it would be like to never grow old or die. One day, Dorian meets a man named Lord Henry Wotton, who tells him that the only thing that truly matters in life is experiencing as much pleasure as possible. Dorian is entranced by Lord Henry's words and decides that he wants to live a life of hedonism. Basil tries to warn Dorian about the dangers of giving into temptation, but Dorian doesn't listen. He makes a wish that the portrait Basil painted of him would age instead of him. As Dorian indulges in a life of excess, the portrait hidden away in his attic gradually changes to reflect his corrupted soul. Dorian remains young and handsome, while the portrait becomes a hideous monster. One day, Dorian's conscience finally catches up with him and he realizes the error of his ways. He tries to destroy the portrait, but it seems to have a life of its own and Dorian can't bring himself to do it. In the end, Dorian is killed by the portrait and his soul is trapped inside of it forever.\n\nStory so far:  The artist creates beautiful things, but the critic can translate those things into something new.

The nineteenth century dislike of romanticism is the rage of Caliban not seeing his own face in a glass.

{"prompt": "Outline: Dorian Gray is a young man who is incredibly handsome. He becomes friends with a painter named Basil Hallward, who is completely infatuated with Dorian's beauty and paints a portrait of him. Dorian becomes obsessed with his own beauty and wonders what it would be like to never grow old or die. One day, Dorian meets a man named Lord Henry Wotton, who tells him that the only thing that truly matters in life is experiencing as much pleasure as possible. Dorian is entranced by Lord Henry's words and decides that he wants to live a life of hedonism. Basil tries to warn Dorian about the dangers of giving into temptation, but Dorian doesn't listen. He makes a wish that the portrait Basil painted of him would age instead of him. As Dorian indulges in a life of excess, the portrait hidden away in his attic gradually changes to reflect his corrupted soul. Dorian remains young and handsome, while the portrait becomes a hideous monster. One day, Dorian's conscience finally catches up with him and he realizes the error of his ways. He tries to destroy the portrait, but it seems to have a life of its own and Dorian can't bring himself to do it.

Some day, when you are old and wrinkled and ugly, when thought has seared your forehead with its lines, and passion branded your lips with its hideous fires, you will feel it, you will feel it terribly. Now, wherever you go, you charm the world. Will it always be so? ... You have a wonderfully beautiful face, Mr. Gray. Don\u2019t frown. You have. And beauty is a form of genius\u2014is higher, indeed, than genius, as it needs no explanation. It is of the great facts of the world, like sunlight, or spring-time, or the reflection in dark waters of that silver shell we call the moon. It cannot be questioned. It has its divine right of sovereignty. It makes princes of those who have it. You smile? Ah! when you have lost it you won\u2019t smile.... People say sometimes that beauty is only superficial. That may be so, but at least it is not so superficial as thought is. To me, beauty is the wonder of wonders. It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances. The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible.... Yes, Mr. Gray, the gods have been good to you. But what the gods give they quickly take away. You have only a few years in which to live really, perfectly, and fully. When your youth goes, your beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you, or have to content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter than defeats.

{"prompt": "Outline: Dorian Gray is a young man who is incredibly handsome. He becomes friends with a painter named Basil Hallward, who is completely infatuated with Dorian's beauty and paints a portrait of him. Dorian becomes obsessed with his own beauty and wonders what it would be like to never grow old or die. One day, Dorian meets a man named Lord Henry Wotton, who tells him that the only thing that truly matters in life is experiencing as much pleasure as possible. Dorian is entranced by Lord Henry's words and decides that he wants to live a life of hedonism. Basil tries to warn Dorian about the dangers of giving into temptation, but Dorian doesn't listen. He makes a wish that the portrait Basil painted of him would age instead of him. As Dorian indulges in a life of excess, the portrait hidden away in his attic gradually changes to reflect his corrupted soul. Dorian remains young and handsome, while the portrait becomes a hideous monster. One day, Dorian's conscience finally catches up with him and he realizes the error of his ways. He tries to destroy the portrait, but it seems to have a life of its own and Dorian can't bring himself to do it. In the end, Dorian is killed by the portrait and his soul is trapped inside of it forever.\n\nStory so far: This passage discusses the idea that art is useless, and that genius does not last longer than beauty. It argues that if everyone lived their life to the fullest, the world would be a happier place. However, people are afraid of themselves and the things they want, so they sin and are punished for it. The passage discusses the transitory nature of beauty and youth, and how they are often taken for granted. It argues that beauty is a form of genius, and that those who have it should enjoy it while they can. The passage describes Dorian Gray's reaction to seeing his own portrait for the first time. He is struck by its beauty and realizes that his own beauty will one day fade. Dorian Gray is upset because he will age and his portrait will not. He wishes he could trade places with the portrait. Dorian is angry with the painter for creating a portrait of him, because it will always remain young and beautiful while Dorian himself will age and die.

At half-past twelve next day Lord Henry Wotton strolled from Curzon Street over to the Albany to call on his uncle, Lord Fermor, a genial if somewhat rough-mannered old bachelor, whom the outside world called selfish because it derived no particular benefit from him, but who was considered generous by Society as he fed the people who amused him. His father had been our ambassador at Madrid when Isabella was young and Prim unthought of, but had retired from the diplomatic service in a capricious moment of annoyance on not being offered the Embassy at Paris, a post to which he considered that he was fully entitled by reason of his birth, his indolence, the good English of his dispatches, and his inordinate passion for pleasure. The son, who had been his father\u2019s secretary, had resigned along with his chief, somewhat foolishly as was thought at the time, and on succeeding some months later to the title, had set himself to the serious study of the great aristocratic art of doing absolutely nothing.

They recount how their childhood dream of going on a great voyage was reignited when they inherited their cousin's fortune. They have prepared for the journey by training their body and studying various sciences. Although they are aware of the risks involved, they feel that the rewards are worth it. The passage describes the author's feelings of loneliness and isolation, and his desire for a friend who can understand and sympathize with him. He laments his lack of education and formal training, and wishes for someone who can help him to control and focus his thoughts. This passage describes the author's lieutenant and master, both of whom are men of great character. The author first met the lieutenant on a whale vessel and was impressed by his courage and desire for glory. The author then met the master and was impressed by his kindness, courage, and respect from his crew. A man loved a young Russian woman but she was in love with someone else. He gave her to her lover and left the country. The speaker is looking forward to their upcoming voyage to unexplored regions, and is preparing to depart. They are excited and nervous about what they will find, and hope to kill no albatrosses.

The stranger is excited by the prospect of seeing the other sledge again, but is too weak to be on deck. The narrator has promised to keep watch for him. The narrator has found a stranger on a ship who appears to be ill. The stranger gradually improves, but is very quiet and seems uneasy around others. The narrator begins to feel compassion and affection for the stranger.\n\nLast chunk: in sight.  Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the present day. The stranger has gradually improved in health but is very silent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin. Yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all interested in him, although they have had very little communication with him. For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother, and his constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion. He must have been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck so attractive and amiable.  I said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no friend on the wide ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit had been broken by misery, I should have been happy to have possessed as the brother of my heart.  I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals, should I have any fresh incidents to record.     August 13th, 17\u2014.   My affection for my guest increases every day. He excites at once my admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree. How can I see so noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant grief? He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, and when he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art, yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.  He is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck, apparently watching for the sledge that preceded\n\nNext chunk:", "completion": "his own.

They knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too would be over and casually put away.

Mr. Darcy walked off; and       Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She       told the story, however, with great spirit among her friends; for       she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in       anything ridiculous.        The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.       Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the       Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she       had been distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified       by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way.       Elizabeth felt Jane\u2019s pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned       to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the       neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough       to be never without partners, which was all that they had yet       learnt to care for at a ball.

As the two couples get to know each other, they begin to see beyond their initial impressions and fall in love.\n\nStory so far: Mr. Bingley, a wealthy young man, is moving into the neighborhood. Mrs. Bennet is insistent that they meet him, but Mr. Bennet is not interested. Mr. Darcy is a wealthy man who is considered to be very handsome, but he is also very proud and arrogant. The passage describes Mr. Darcy's conversation with Mr. Bingley about the Bennet sisters. Mr. Darcy is not interested in dancing with any of the Bennet sisters, but Mr. Bingley finds them all very pleasant and pretty. Mr. Darcy is rude to Elizabeth and she is not pleased. This passage discusses Elizabeth's surprise at being complimented by a young man, and her friend's observations about her tendency to see the good in everyone. The passage describes the sisters of a man that the speaker likes. The speaker thinks they are proud and conceited, but notes that they are still pleasant to talk to. Mr. Bingley inherited property from his father and intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. His sisters were very anxious for him to have an estate of his own. Mr. Bingley was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House and took it immediately. Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of great opposition of character. Darcy and Bingley have very different opinions of the people they meet at the Meryton assembly. Bingley find everyone pleasant and pretty, while Darcy finds them uninteresting and unattractive.\n\nLast chunk: his temper,       though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own,       and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied. On the       strength of Darcy\u2019s regard Bingley had the firmest reliance, and       of his judgment the highest opinion. In understanding, Darcy was       the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was       clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and       fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting.       In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was       sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually       giving offence.        The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was       sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with       pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been       most kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, no       stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and as       to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful.       Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom       there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had       felt the smallest interest, and from none received either       attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,       but she smiled too much.        Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so\u2014but still they       admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to\n\nNext chunk:", "completion": "be a sweet girl,       and one whom they should not object to know more of.

Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy, a wealthy man who is new to the neighborhood, seems to disdain all the residents. When he meets the lively and beautiful Miss Elizabeth Bennet, he is intrigued but still unsure. As the two couples get to know each other, they begin to see beyond their initial impressions and fall in love.\n\nStory so far: The passage discusses the idea that happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance, and that it is better to know as little as possible about the defects of the person you are going to spend your life with. The author argues that it is better to know as little as possible about the defects of the person you are going to spend your life with. The author also observes that Mr. Darcy, who initially thought Elizabeth was not pretty, began to find her more attractive after he realized that she was intelligent and had expressive eyes. Elizabeth is walking to Meryton when she is joined by her sisters Catherine and Lydia. They walk quickly and eventually part ways, with Elizabeth continuing on alone. She arrives at her destination with tired feet and a face flushed from the exercise. Elizabeth is surprised to find Jane at breakfast with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, who seem to disapprove of her having walked three miles in the cold. Mr. Darcy and Mr. Hurst are also there. Elizabeth enquires after her sister and is taken to see her immediately. Jane is delighted to see her but is too ill to speak much. The passage describes Elizabeth's reaction to seeing her sister Jane being treated for a cold by the apothecary. Elizabeth stays with her sister at Netherfield and is joined by the other sisters. The family is notified of her stay and a servant is sent to Longbourn to bring back clothes.\n\nLast chunk: treated with. Elizabeth silently attended her.        When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and       Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much       affection and solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary       came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be       supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must       endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed,       and promised her some draughts. The advice was followed readily,       for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely.       Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were the other       ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact       nothing to do elsewhere.        When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and       very unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage,       and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane       testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was       obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to       remain at Netherfield for the present. Elizabeth most thankfully       consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint       the family with her stay, and bring back a supply of clothes.     Chapter 8        At five o\u2019clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past       six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner.

Jane was by no means       better. The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four       times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a       bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves;       and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference       towards Jane when not immediately before them, restored Elizabeth       to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.        Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she       could regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was       evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they       prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed       she was considered by the others. She had very little notice from       any but him. Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister       scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he       was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at       cards; who, when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout,       had nothing to say to her.        When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss       Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her       manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride       and impertinence;"}

The careless security of his life in the Custom-House, on a regular income, and with but slight and infrequent apprehensions of removal, had no doubt contributed to make time pass lightly over him. The original and more potent causes, however, lay in the rare perfection of his animal nature, the moderate proportion of intellect, and the very trifling admixture of moral and spiritual ingredients; these latter qualities, indeed, being in barely enough measure to keep the old gentleman from walking on all-fours. He possessed no power of thought, no depth of feeling, no troublesome sensibilities; nothing, in short, but a few commonplace instincts, which, aided by the cheerful temper that grew inevitably out of his physical well-being, did duty very respectably, and to general acceptance, in lieu of a heart. He had been the husband of three wives, all long since dead; the father of twenty children, most of whom, at every age of childhood or maturity, had likewise returned to dust. Here, one would suppose, might have been sorrow enough to imbue the sunniest disposition, through and through, with a sable tinge. Not so with our old Inspector! One brief sigh sufficed to carry off the entire burden of these dismal reminiscences. The next moment, he was as ready for sport as any unbreeched infant; far readier than the Collector\u2019s junior clerk, who, at nineteen years, was much the elder and graver man of the two.

{"prompt": "Outline: A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens is a story about the French Revolution. The story begins in 1775 and is set in London and Paris. The main characters are Dr. Manette, Lucie Manette, Charles Darnay, and Sydney Carton. Dr. Manette is a doctor who is released from prison after eighteen years. He is reunited with his daughter, Lucie, and they move to Paris. Charles Darnay is a French aristocrat who is accused of being a traitor and is sentenced to death. Sydney Carton is an English lawyer who defends Darnay and falls in love with Lucie. The story is a love story, a story of redemption, and a story of the French Revolution.\n\nStory so far: This passage compares the winter of 1775 to the present day, noting that both periods had their share of problems. It describes the lawlessness and violence that were commonplace in England at the time, and the French Revolution, during which many people were sentenced to brutal punishments for relatively minor offenses. Despite the prophecies of bad things happening in both periods, the author notes that in the end, these prophecies did not come to fruition. The passage describes a scene in which a rider delivers a message to a guard, who then reads it aloud. The message is simply \"Recalled to Life,\" but the guard is surprised by it. The rider then leaves, and the other passengers pretend to be asleep. The guard on the coach is worried about the message he heard and decides to investigate. Jerry, left alone, dismounts to take a break and check on his horse. The passage reflects on the idea that every person is a mystery to everyone else, and that this is something that can be both wonderful and terrible.
