She stared at a chessboard on a low table.\n\n'Nora dear, it's natural to worry about your future,' said the librarian, Mrs Elm, her eyes glimmering like sunshine on frost.\n\nMrs Elm made her first move. A knight hopping over the neat row of white pawns. 'Of course, you're going to be worried about the exams. But you could be anything you want to be, Nora. Think of all that possibility. It's exciting.'\n\n'Yes. I suppose it is.'\n\n'A whole life in front of you.'\n\n'A whole life.'\n\n'You could do anything, live anywhere. Somewhere a bit less cold and wet.'\n\nNora pushed a pawn forward two spaces.\n\nIt was hard not to compare Mrs Elm to her mother, who treated Nora like a mistake in need of correction. For instance, when she was a baby her mother had been so worried Nora's left ear stuck out more than her right that she'd used sticky tape to address the situation, then disguised it beneath a woollen bonnet.\n\n'I hate the cold and wet,' added Mrs Elm, for emphasis.\n\nMrs Elm had short grey hair and a kind and mildly crinkled oval face sitting pale above her turtle-green polo neck. She was quite old. But she was also the person most on Nora's wavelength in the entire school, and even on days when it wasn't raining she would spend her afternoon break in the small library.\n\n'Coldness and wetness don't always go together,' Nora told her. 'Antarctica is the driest continent on Earth. Technically, it's a desert.'\n\n'Well, that sounds up your street.'\n\n'I don't think it's far enough away.'\n\n'Well, maybe you should be an astronaut. Travel the galaxy.'\n\nNora smiled. 'The rain is even worse on other planets.'\n\n'Worse than Bedfordshire?'\n\n'On Venus it is pure acid.'\n\nMrs Elm pulled a paper tissue from her sleeve and delicately blew her nose. 'See? With a brain like yours you can do anything.'\n\nA blond boy Nora recognised from a couple of years below her ran past outside the rain-speckled window. Either chasing someone or being chased. Since her brother had left, she'd felt a bit unguarded out there. The library was a little shelter of civilisation.\n\n'Dad thinks I've thrown everything away. Now I've stopped swimming.'\n\n'Well, far be it from me to say, but there is more to this world than swimming really fast. There are many different possible lives ahead of you. Like I said last week, you could be a glaciologist. I've been researching and the'\n\nAnd it was then that the phone rang.\n\n'One minute,' said Mrs Elm, softly. 'I'd better get that.'\n\nA moment later, Nora watched Mrs Elm on the phone. 'Yes. She's here now.' The librarian's face fell in shock. She turned away from Nora, but her words were audible across the hushed room: 'Oh no. No. Oh my God. Of course . . .'"}]}

And then, out of nowhere, something actually did.\n\nSomeone, for whatever peculiar reason, rang her doorbell.\n\nShe wondered for a moment if she shouldn\u2019t get the door at all. She was, after all, already in her night clothes even though it was only nine p.m. She felt self-conscious about her over-sized ECO WORRIER T-shirt and her tartan pyjama bottoms.\n\nShe put on her slippers, to be slightly more civilised, and discovered that the person at the door was a man, and one she recognised.\n\nHe was tall and gangly and boyish, with a kind face, but his eyes were sharp and bright, like they could see through things.\n\nIt was good to see him, if a little surprising, especially as he was wearing sports gear and he looked hot and sweaty despite the cold, rainy weather. The juxtaposition between them made her feel even more slovenly than she had done five seconds earlier.\n\nBut she\u2019d been feeling lonely. And though she\u2019d studied enough existential philosophy to believe loneliness was a fundamental part of being a human in an essentially meaningless universe, it was good to see him.\n\n\u2018Ash,\u2019 she said, smiling. \u2018It\u2019s Ash, isn\u2019t it?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes. It is.\u2019\n\n\u2018What are you doing here? It\u2019s good to see you.\u2019\n\nA few weeks ago she\u2019d been sat playing her electric piano and he\u2019d run down Bancroft Avenue and had seen her in the window here at 33A and given her a little wave. He had once \u2013 years ago \u2013 asked her out for a coffee. Maybe he was about to do that again.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s good to see you too,\u2019 he said, but his tense forehead didn\u2019t show it.\n\nWhen she\u2019d spoken to him in the shop, he\u2019d always sounded breezy, but now his voice contained something heavy. He scratched his brow. Made another sound but didn\u2019t quite manage a full word.\n\n\u2018You running?\u2019 A pointless question. He was clearly out for a run. But he seemed relieved, momentarily, to have something trivial to say.\n\n\u2018Yeah. I\u2019m doing the Bedford Half. It\u2019s this Sunday.\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh right. Great. I was thinking of doing a half-marathon and then I remembered I hate running.\u2019\n\nThis had sounded funnier in her head than it did as actual words being vocalised out of her mouth. She didn\u2019t even hate running. But still, she was perturbed to see the seriousness of his expression. The silence went beyond awkward into something else.\n\n\u2018You told me you had a cat,\u2019 he said eventually.\n\n\u2018Yes. I have a cat.\u2019\n\n\u2018I remembered his name. Voltaire. A ginger tabby?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yeah. I call him Volts. He finds Voltaire a bit pretentious. It turns out he\u2019s not massively into eighteenth-century French philosophy and literature. He\u2019s quite down-to-earth. You know. For a cat.\u2019\n\nAsh looked down at her slippers.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m afraid I think he\u2019s dead.\u2019\n\n\u2018What?\u2019\n\n\u2018He\u2019s lying very still by the side of the road. I saw the name on the collar, I think a car might have hit him. I\u2019m sorry, Nora.\u2019\n\nShe was so scared of her sudden switch in emotions right then that she kept smiling, as if the smile could keep her in the world she had just been in, the one where Volts was alive and where this man she\u2019d sold guitar songbooks to had rung her doorbell for another reason.\n\nAsh, she remembered, was a surgeon. Not a veterinary one, a general human one. If he said something was dead it was, in all probability, dead.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m so sorry.\u2019\n\nNora had a familiar sense of grief. Only the sertraline stopped her crying. \u2018Oh God.\u2019\n\nShe stepped out onto the wet cracked paving slabs of Bancroft Avenue, hardly breathing, and saw the poor ginger-furred creature lying on the rain-glossed tarmac beside the kerb. His head grazed the side of the pavement and his legs were back as if in mid-gallop, chasing some imaginary bird.\n\n\u2018Oh Volts. Oh no. Oh God.\u2019\n\nShe knew she should be experiencing pity and despair for her feline friend \u2013 and she was \u2013 but she had to acknowledge something else. As she stared at Voltaire\u2019s still and peaceful expression \u2013 that total absence of pain \u2013 there was an inescapable feeling brewing in the darkness.\n\nEnvy."}]}

She was standing on a path, some kind of colonnade. The columns were brain-grey, with specks of brilliant blue. The misty vapours cleared, like spirits wanting to be unwatched, and a shape emerged.\n\nA solid, rectangular shape.\n\nThe shape of a building. About the size of a church or a small supermarket. It had a stone facade, the same colouration as the pillars, with a large wooden central door and a roof which had aspirations of grandeur, with intricate details and a grand-looking clock on the front gable, with black-painted Roman numerals and its hands pointing to midnight. Tall dark arched windows, framed with stone bricks, punctuated the front wall, equidistant from each other. When she first looked it seemed there were only four windows, but a moment later there were definitely five of them. She thought she must have miscounted.\n\nAs there was nothing else around, and since she had nowhere else to be, Nora stepped cautiously towards it.\n\nShe looked at the digital display of her watch.\n\n00:00:00\n\nMidnight, as the clock had told her.\n\nShe waited for the next second to arrive, but it didn\u2019t. Even as she walked closer to the building, even as she opened the wooden door, even as she stepped inside, the display didn\u2019t change. Either something was wrong with her watch, or something was wrong with time. In the circumstances, it could have been either.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening? she wondered. What the hell is going on?\n\nMaybe this place would hold some answers, she thought, as she walked inside. The place was well lit, and the floor was light stone \u2013 somewhere between light yellow and camel-brown, like the colour of an old page \u2013 but the windows she had seen on the outside weren\u2019t there on the inside. In fact, even though she had only taken a few steps forward she could no longer see the walls at all. Instead, there were bookshelves. Aisles and aisles of shelves, reaching up to the ceiling and branching off from the broad open corridor Nora was walking down. She turned down one of the aisles and stopped to gaze in bafflement at the seemingly endless amount of books.\n\nThe books were everywhere, on shelves so thin they might as well have been invisible. The books were all green. Greens of multifarious shades. Some of these volumes were a murky swamp green, some a bright and light chartreuse, some a bold emerald and others the verdant shade of summer lawns.\n\nAnd on the subject of summer lawns: despite the fact that the books looked old, the air in the library felt fresh. It had a lush, grassy, outdoors kind of smell, not the dusty scent of old tomes.\n\nThe shelves really did seem to go on for ever, straight and long towards a far-off horizon, like lines indicating one-point perspective in a school art project, broken only by the occasional corridor.\n\nShe picked a corridor at random and set off. At the next turn, she took a left and became a little lost. She searched for a way out, but there was no sign of an exit. She attempted to retrace her steps towards the entrance, but it was impossible.\n\nEventually she had to conclude she wasn\u2019t going to find the exit.\n\n\u2018This is abnormal,\u2019 she said to herself, to find comfort in the sound of her own voice. \u2018Definitely abnormal.\u2019\n\nNora stopped and stepped closer to some of the books.\n\nThere were no titles or author names adorning the spines. Aside from the difference of shade, the only other variation was size: the books were of similar height but varied in width. Some had spines two inches wide, others significantly less. One or two weren\u2019t much more than pamphlets.\n\nShe reached to pull out one of the books, choosing a medium-sized one in a slightly drab olive colour. It looked a bit dusty and worn.\n\nBefore she had pulled it clean from the shelf, she heard a voice behind her and she jumped back.\n\n\u2018Be careful,\u2019 the voice said.\n\nAnd Nora turned around to see who was there."}]}

The chapters got much longer as the book progressed, year by year. But the regrets she accumulated weren\u2019t specifically related to that year in question.\n\n\u2018Regrets ignore chronology. They float around. The sequence of these lists changes all the time.\u2019\n\n\u2018Right, yes, that makes sense, I suppose.\u2019\n\nShe quickly realised they ranged from the minor and quotidian (\u2018I regret not doing any exercise today\u2019) to the substantial (\u2018I regret not telling my father I loved him before he died\u2019).\n\nThere were continual, background regrets, which repeated on multiple pages. \u2018I regret not staying in The Labyrinths, because I let down my brother.\u2019 \u2018I regret not staying in The Labyrinths, because I let down myself.\u2019 \u2018I regret not doing more for the environment.\u2019 \u2018I regret the time I spent on social media.\u2019 \u2018I regret not going to Australia with Izzy.\u2019 \u2018I regret not having more fun when I was younger.\u2019 \u2018I regret all those arguments with Dad.\u2019 \u2018I regret not working with animals.\u2019 \u2018I regret not doing Geology at University instead of Philosophy.\u2019 \u2018I regret not learning how to be a happier person.\u2019 \u2018I regret feeling so much guilt.\u2019 \u2018I regret not sticking at Spanish.\u2019 \u2018I regret not choosing science subjects in my A-levels.\u2019 \u2018I regret not becoming a glaciologist.\u2019 \u2018I regret not getting married.\u2019 \u2018I regret not applying to do a Master\u2019s degree in Philosophy at Cambridge.\u2019 \u2018I regret not keeping healthy.\u2019 \u2018I regret moving to London.\u2019 \u2018I regret not going to Paris to teach English.\u2019 \u2018I regret not finishing the novel I started at university.\u2019 \u2018I regret moving out of London.\u2019 \u2018I regret having a job with no prospects.\u2019 \u2018I regret not being a better sister.\u2019 \u2018I regret not having a gap year after university.\u2019 \u2018I regret disappointing my father.\u2019 \u2018I regret that I teach piano more than I play it.\u2019 \u2018I regret my financial mismanagement.\u2019 \u2018I regret not living in the countryside.\u2019\n\nSome regrets were a little fainter than others. One regret shifted from practically invisible to bold and back again, as if it was flashing on and off, right there as she looked at it. The regret was \u2018I regret not yet having children.\u2019\n\n\u2018That is a regret that sometimes is and sometimes isn\u2019t,\u2019 explained Mrs Elm, again somehow reading her mind. \u2018There are a few of those.\u2019\n\nFrom the age of 34 onwards, in the longest chapter at the end of the book, there were a lot of Dan-specific regrets. These were quite strong and bold, and played in her head like an ongoing fortissimo chord in a Haydn concerto.\n\n\u2018I regret being cruel to Dan.\u2019 \u2018I regret breaking up with Dan.\u2019 \u2018I regret not living in a country pub with Dan.\u2019\n\nAs she stared down at the pages, she thought now of the man she had so nearly married."}]}

Big smile, short beard. Visually, a TV vet. Fun, curious. He drank quite a bit, but always seemed immune to hangovers.\n\nHe had studied Art History and put his in-depth knowledge of Rubens and Tintoretto to incredible use by becoming head of PR for a brand of protein flapjacks. He did, however, have a dream. And his dream was to run a pub in the countryside. A dream he wanted to share with her. With Nora.\n\nAnd she got carried away with his enthusiasm. Got engaged. But suddenly she had realised she didn\u2019t want to marry him.\n\nDeep down, she was scared of becoming her mother. She didn\u2019t want to replicate her parents\u2019 marriage.\n\nStill staring blankly at The Book of Regrets, she wondered if her parents had ever been in love or if they had got married because marriage was something you did at the appropriate time with the nearest available person. A game where you grabbed the first person you could find when the music stopped.\n\nShe had never wanted to play that game.\n\nBertrand Russell wrote that \u2018To fear love is to fear life, and those who fear life are already three-parts dead\u2019. Maybe that was her problem. Maybe she was just scared of living. But Bertrand Russell had more marriages and affairs than hot dinners, so perhaps he was no one to give advice.\n\nWhen her mum died three months before the wedding Nora\u2019s grief was immense. Though she had suggested that the date should be put back, it somehow never was, and Nora\u2019s grief fused with depression and anxiety and the feeling that her life was out of her own control. The wedding seemed such a symptom of this chaotic feeling, that she felt tied to a train track, and the only way she could loosen the ropes and free herself was to pull out of the wedding. Though, in reality, staying in Bedford and being single, and letting Izzy down about their Australia plans, and starting work at String Theory, and getting a cat, had all felt like the opposite of freedom.\n\n\u2018Oh no,\u2019 said Mrs Elm, breaking Nora\u2019s thoughts. \u2018It\u2019s too much for you.\u2019\n\nAnd suddenly she was back feeling all this contrition, all that pain of letting people down and letting herself down, the pain she had tried to escape less than an hour ago. The regrets began to swarm together. In fact, while staring at the open pages of the book, the pain was actually worse than it had been wandering around Bedford. The power of all the regrets simultaneously emanating from the book was becoming agony. The weight of guilt and remorse and sorrow too strong. She leaned back on her elbows, dropped the heavy book and squeezed her eyes shut. She could hardly breathe, as if invisible hands were around her neck.\n\n\u2018Make it stop!\u2019\n\n\u2018Close it now,\u2019 instructed Mrs Elm. \u2018Close the book. Not just your eyes. Close it. You have to do it yourself.\u2019\n\nSo Nora, feeling like she was about to pass out, sat back up and placed her hand under the front cover. It felt even heavier now but she managed to close the book and gasped in relief."}]}

She was as still as the permafrost she stood on.\n\nFuck.\n\nFuck fuck.\n\nFuck fuck fucking fuck.\n\nFuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.\n\nEventually a survival impulse kicked in and Nora raised the signal pistol and fired it, and the flare shot out like a tiny comet and disappeared into the water, the glow fading along with her hope.

With someone dressed in a uniform. Like a nurse\u2019s outfit. I think she was heading into the care home after a walk. She looked very frail.

They had a half-drunk bottle of wine that the restaurant let them take home.

The house was made even smaller by the amount of dogs there. There were five that Nora could see, though there may have been more lurking upstairs. Nora had always imagined she liked the smell of dog, but she suddenly realised there was a limit to this fondness.\n\nSitting down on the sofa she felt something hard beneath her \u2013 a plastic ring for the dogs to gnaw on. She put it on the carpet amid the other chew toys. The toy bone. The foam yellow ball with chunks bitten out of it. A half-massacred soft toy.\n\nA Chihuahua with cataracts tried to have sex with her right leg.\n\n\u2018Stop that, Pedro,\u2019 said Dylan, laughing, as he pulled the little creature away from her.\n\nAnother dog, a giant, meaty, chestnut-coloured Newfoundland, was sitting next to her on the sofa, licking Nora\u2019s ear with a tongue the size of a slipper, meaning that Dylan had to sit on the floor.\n\n\u2018Do you want the sofa?\u2019\n\n\u2018No. I\u2019m fine on the floor.\u2019\n\nNora didn\u2019t push it.

He wants his daddy\u2019), Nora realised she wasn\u2019t too enamoured with this life.\n\nAnd also, Dylan deserved the other Nora. The one who had managed to fall in love with him.

It was a pretty ropey Zinfandel from California. She stared at the label on the back. There was for some reason a mini co-autobiography of a woman and a man, Janine and Terence Thornton, who owned the vineyard which had made the wine. She read the last sentence: When we were first married we always dreamed of opening our own vineyard one day. And now we have made that dream a reality. Here at Dry Creek Valley, our life tastes as good as a glass of Zinfandel.\n\nShe stroked the large dog who\u2019d been licking her and whispered a \u2018goodbye\u2019 into the Newfoundland\u2019s wide, warm brow as she left Dylan and his dogs behind."}]}

They\u2019re looked after. The flowers have water.\u2019 And the words echoed in Nora\u2019s mind. They\u2019ll be okay. They\u2019re looked after . . . And then Ash said something about going to the cinema tonight and how the babysitter was all arranged and Nora had forgotten completely but just smiled and tried really hard to hold on, to stay there, but it was happening, it was happening, she knew it from within every hidden chamber of her being, and there was absolutely nothing she could do to stop it."}]}

She had been put on a ward and had eaten and was feeling a lot better. The medical staff were pleased, following her physical examination. The tender abdomen was to be expected, apparently. She tried to impress the doctor by telling her a fact Ash had told her, about a stomach lining renewing itself every few days.\n\nThen a nurse came and sat on her bed with a clipboard and went through reams of questions relating to her state of mind. Nora decided to keep her experience of the Midnight Library to herself because she imagined that it wouldn\u2019t go down too well on a psychiatric evaluation form.

Mrs. Elm and Nora talk about the fact that each life Nora has tried was part of someone else\u2019s dream: her father\u2019s dream of her becoming a swimmer to make up for his rugby injury or her brother\u2019s dream of The Labyrinths making it big.

Nora picks out a life that\u2019s no one else\u2019s dream, the life in which she has decided to work with animals."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Someone Else\u2019s Dream\n\n\u2018Life is always an act,\u2019 Mrs Elm said, as they watched her brother being pulled back from the water\u2019s edge by his friends. As he then watched a girl whose name she\u2019d long forgotten make an emergency call. \u2018And you acted when it counted. You swam to that bank. You clawed yourself out. You coughed your guts out and had hypothermia but you crossed the river, against incredible odds. You found something inside you.\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes. Bacteria. I was ill for weeks. I swallowed so much of that shitty water.\u2019\n\n\u2018But you lived. You had hope.\u2019\n\n\u2018Yeah, well, I was losing it by the day.\u2019\n\nShe stared down, to see the grass shrink back into the stone, and looked back to catch the last sight of the water before it shimmered away and the sycamore tree dissolved into air along with her brother and his friends and her own young self.\n\nThe library looked exactly like the library again. But now the books were all back on the shelves and the lights had stopped flickering.\n\n\u2018I was so stupid, doing that swim, just trying to impress people. I always thought Joe was better than me. I wanted him to like me.\u2019\n\n\u2018Why did you think he was better than you? Because your parents did?\u2019\n\nNora felt angry at Mrs Elm\u2019s directness. But maybe she had a point. \u2018I always had to do what they wanted me to do in order to impress them. Joe had his issues, obviously. And I didn\u2019t really understand those issues until I knew he was gay, but they say sibling rivalry isn\u2019t about siblings but parents, and I always felt my parents just encouraged his dreams a bit more.\u2019\n\n\u2018Like music?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yeah.\u2019\n\n\u2018When he and Ravi decided they wanted to be rock stars, Mum and Dad bought Joe a guitar and then an electric piano.\u2019\n\n\u2018How did that go?\u2019\n\n\u2018The guitar bit went well. He could play \u201cSmoke On The Water\u201d within a week of getting it, but he wasn\u2019t into the piano and decided he didn\u2019t want it cluttering up his room.\u2019\n\n\u2018And that\u2019s when you got it.\u2019 Mrs Elm said this as a statement rather than a question. She knew. Of course she knew.\n\n\u2018Yeah.\u2019\n\n\u2018It was moved into your room, and you welcomed it like a friend, and started learning to play it with steadfast determination. You spent your pocket money on piano-teaching guides and Mozart for Beginners and The Beatles for Piano. Because you liked it. But also because you wanted to impress your older brother.\u2019\n\n\u2018I never told you all this.\u2019\n\nA wry smile. \u2018Don\u2019t worry. I read the book.\u2019\n\n\u2018Right. Course. Yeah. Got you.\u2019\n\n\u2018You might need to stop worrying about other people\u2019s approval, Nora,\u2019 Mrs Elm said in a whisper, for added power and intimacy. \u2018You don\u2019t need a permission slip to be your\u2014\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes. I get it.\u2019\n\nAnd she did get it.\n\nEvery life she had tried so far since entering the library had really been someone else\u2019s dream. The married life in the pub had been Dan\u2019s dream. The trip to Australia had been Izzy\u2019s dream, and her regret about not going had been a guilt for her best friend more than a sorrow for herself. The dream of her becoming a swimming champion belonged to her father. And okay, so it was true that she had been interested in the Arctic and being a glaciologist when she was younger, but that had been steered quite significantly by her chats with Mrs Elm herself, back in the school library. And The Labyrinths, well, that had always been her brother\u2019s dream.\n\nMaybe there was no perfect life for her, but somewhere, surely, there was a life worth living. And if she was to find a life truly worth living, she realised she would have to cast a wider net.\n\nMrs Elm was right. The game wasn\u2019t over. No player should give up if there were pieces still left on the board.\n\nShe straightened her back and stood up tall.\n\n\u2018You need to choose more lives from the bottom or top shelves. You have been seeking to undo your most obvious regrets. The books on the higher and lower shelves are the lives a little bit further removed. Lives you are still living in one universe or another but not ones you have been imagining or mourning or thinking about. They are lives you could live but never dreamed of.\u2019\n\n\u2018So they\u2019re unhappy lives?\u2019\n\n\u2018Some will be, some won\u2019t be. It\u2019s just they are not the most obvious lives. They are ones which might require a little imagination to reach. But I am sure you can get there .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u2019\n\n\u2018Can\u2019t you guide me?\u2019\n\nMrs Elm smiled. \u2018I could read you a poem. Librarians like poems.\u2019 And then she quoted Robert Frost. \u2018Two roads diverged in a wood, and I \u2013 / I took the one less travelled by, / And that has made all the difference .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u2019\n\n\u2018What if there are more than two roads diverging in the wood? What if there are more roads than trees? What if there is no end to the choices you could make? What would Robert Frost do then?\u2019\n\nShe remembered studying Aristotle as a first-year Philosophy student. And being a bit depressed by his idea that excellence was never an accident. That excellent outcomes were the result of \u2018the wise choice of many alternatives\u2019. And here she was, in the privileged position of being able to sample these many alternatives. It was a shortcut to wisdom and maybe a shortcut to happiness too. She saw it now not as a burden but a gift to be cherished.\n\n\u2018Look at that chessboard we put back in place,\u2019 said Mrs Elm, softly. \u2018Look at how ordered and safe and peaceful it looks now, before a game starts. It\u2019s a beautiful thing. But it is boring. It is dead. And yet the moment you make a move on that board, things change. Things begin to get more chaotic. And that chaos builds with every single move you make.\u2019\n\nShe took a seat at the chess table, opposite Mrs Elm. She stared down at the board and moved a pawn two spaces forward.\n\nMrs Elm mirrored the move on her side of the board.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s an easy game to play,\u2019 she told Nora. \u2018But a hard one to master. Every move you make opens a whole new world of possibility.\u2019\n\nNora moved one of her knights. They progressed like this for a little while.\n\nMrs Elm provided a commentary. \u2018At the beginning of a game, there are no variations. There is only one way to set up a board. There are nine million variations after the first six moves. And after eight moves there are two hundred and eighty-eight billion different positions. And those possibilities keep growing. There are more possible ways to play a game of chess than the amount of atoms in the observable universe. So it gets very messy. And there is no right way to play; there are many ways. In chess, as in life, possibility is the basis of everything. Every hope, every dream, every regret, every moment of living.\u2019\n\nEventually, Nora won the game. She had a sneaky suspicion that Mrs Elm had let her, but still she was feeling a bit better.\n\n\u2018Okey-dokey,\u2019 said Mrs Elm. \u2018Now, time for a book, I reckon. What do you say?\u2019\n\nNora gazed along the bookshelves. If only they had more specific titles. If only there was one that said Perfect Life Right Here.\n\nHer initial instinct had been to ignore Mrs Elm\u2019s question. But where there were books, there was always the temptation to open them. And she realised it was the same with lives.\n\nMrs Elm repeated something she said earlier.\n\n\u2018Never underestimate the big importance of small things.\u2019\n\nThis was useful, as it turned out.\n\n\u2018I want,\u2019 she said, \u2018a gentle life. The life where I worked with animals. Where I chose the animal shelter job \u2013 where I did my work experience at school \u2013 over the one at String Theory. Yes. Give me that one, please.\u2019"}]}

Dylan reminds her of a dog with his good-natured, pure demeanor."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A Gentle Life\n\nIt turned out that this particular existence was quite easy to slip into.\n\nSleep was good in this life, and she didn\u2019t wake up until the alarm went off at a quarter to eight. She drove to work in a tatty old Hyundai that smelled of dogs and biscuits and was decorated with crumbs, passing the hospital and the sports centre, and pulling up in the small car park outside the modern, grey-bricked, single-storey rescue centre.\n\nShe spent the morning feeding and walking the dogs. The reason it was quite easy to blend into this life was at least partly because she had been greeted by an affable, down-to-earth woman with brown curly hair and a Yorkshire accent. The woman, Pauline, said Nora was to start work in the dog shelter, rather than the cat shelter, and so Nora had a legitimate excuse to ask what to do and look confused. Also, the issue of knowing people\u2019s names was solved by the fact that all the workers had name badges.\n\nNora had walked a bullmastiff, a new arrival, around the field behind the shelter. Pauline told her that the bullmastiff had been horribly treated by its owner. She pointed out a few small round scars.\n\n\u2018Cigarette burns.\u2019\n\nNora wanted to live in a world where no cruelty existed, but the only worlds she had available to her were worlds with humans in them. The bullmastiff was called Sally. She was scared of everything. Her shadow. Bushes. Other dogs. Nora\u2019s legs. Grass. Air. Though she clearly took a liking to Nora, and even succumbed to a (very quick) tummy rub.\n\nLater, Nora helped clean out some of the little dog huts. She imagined they called them huts because it sounded better than cages, which was really a more apt name for them. There was a three-legged Alsatian called Diesel, who had been there a while apparently. When they played catch, Nora discovered his reflexes were good, his mouth catching the ball almost every time. She liked this life \u2013 or more precisely, she liked the version of herself in this life. She could tell the kind of person she was from the way people spoke to her. It felt nice \u2013 comforting, solidifying \u2013 to be a good person.\n\nHer mind felt different here. She thought a lot in this life, but her thoughts were gentle.\n\n\u2018Compassion is the basis of morality,\u2019 the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer had written, in one of his softer moments. Maybe it was the basis of life too.\n\nThere was one man who worked there called Dylan, who had a natural way with all the dogs. He was about her age, maybe younger. He had a kind, gentle, sad look about him. His long surf-dude hair golden as a retriever. He came and sat next to Nora on a bench at lunch, overlooking the field.\n\n\u2018What are you having today?\u2019 he asked, sweetly, nodding to Nora\u2019s lunchbox.\n\nShe honestly didn\u2019t know \u2013 she had found it already prepared when she\u2019d opened her magnet- and calendar-cluttered fridge that morning. She peeled off the lid to find a cheese and Marmite sandwich and a packet of salt and vinegar crisps. The sky darkened and the wind picked up.\n\n\u2018Oh crap,\u2019 Nora said. \u2018It\u2019s going to rain.\u2019\n\n\u2018Maybe, but the dogs are all still in their cages.\u2019\n\n\u2018Sorry?\u2019\n\n\u2018Dogs can smell when rain is coming, so they often head indoors if they think it\u2019s going to happen. Isn\u2019t that cool? That they can predict the future with their nose?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Nora. \u2018Way cool.\u2019\n\nNora bit into her cheese sandwich. And then Dylan put his arm around her.\n\nNora jumped up.\n\n\u2018\u2014the hell?\u2019 she said.\n\nDylan looked deeply apologetic. And a little horrified at himself. \u2018I\u2019m sorry. Did I hurt your shoulder?\u2019\n\n\u2018No . . . I just . . . I . . . No. No. It\u2019s fine.\u2019\n\nShe discovered that Dylan was her boyfriend and that he had gone to the same secondary school as her. Hazeldene Comp. And that he was two years younger.\n\nNora could remember the day her dad died, when she was in the school library staring as a blond boy from a couple of years below ran past outside the rain-speckled window. Either chasing someone or being chased. That had been him. She had vaguely liked him, from a distance, but without really knowing him or thinking about him at all.\n\n\u2018You all right, Norster?\u2019 Dylan asked.\n\nNorster?\n\n\u2018Yeah. I was just . . . Yeah. I\u2019m fine.\u2019\n\nNora sat down again but left a bit more bench between them. There was nothing overtly wrong with Dylan. He was sweet. And she was sure that in this life she genuinely liked him. Maybe even loved him. But entering a life wasn\u2019t the same as entering an emotion.\n\n\u2018By the way, did you book Gino\u2019s?\u2019\n\nGino\u2019s. The Italian. Nora had gone there as a teenager. She was surprised it was still going.\n\n\u2018What?\u2019\n\n\u2018Gino\u2019s? The pizza place? For tonight? You said you kind of know the manager there.\u2019\n\n\u2018My dad used to, yeah.\u2019\n\n\u2018So, did you manage to call?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 she lied. \u2018But actually, it is fully booked.\u2019\n\n\u2018On a weeknight? Weird. That\u2019s a shame. I love pizza. And pasta. And lasagne. And\u2014\u2019\n\n\u2018Right,\u2019 said Nora. \u2018Yes. I get it. I completely get it. I know it was strange. But they had a couple of big bookings.\u2019\n\nDylan already had his phone out. He was eager. \u2018I\u2019ll try La Cantina. You know. The Mexican. Tons of vegan options. I love a Mexican, don\u2019t you?\u2019\n\nNora couldn\u2019t think of a legitimate reason for her not to do this, aside from Dylan\u2019s not-entirely-riveting conversation, and compared to the sandwich she was currently eating and the state of the rest of her fridge, Mexican food sounded promising.\n\nSo, Dylan booked them a table. And they carried on talking as dogs barked in the building behind them. It emerged during the conversation that they were thinking of moving in together.\n\n\u2018We could watch Last Chance Saloon,\u2019 he said.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t really listening. \u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019\n\nHe was shy, she realised. Bad with eye contact. Quite endearing. \u2018You know, that Ryan Bailey film you wanted to watch. We saw the trailer for it. You said it\u2019s meant to be funny and I did some research and it has an eighty-six per cent on Rotten Tomatoes and it\u2019s on Netflix so . . .\u2019\n\nShe wondered if Dylan would believe her if she told him that in one life she was a lead singer of an internationally successful pop-rock band and global icon who had actually dated and voluntarily broken up with Ryan Bailey.\n\n\u2018Sounds good,\u2019 she said, as she stared at an empty crisp packet floating across the sparse grass.\n\nDylan rushed off the bench to grab the packet and dropped it into the bin next to the bench.\n\nHe flopped back to Nora, smiling. Nora understood what this other Nora saw in him. There was something pure about him. Like a dog himself."}]}

The familiarity of it felt strange. When she reached the shop she saw that something wasn\u2019t right. There were no guitars in the window. There was nothing in the window, except a faded piece of A4 paper stuck on the inside of the glass.\n\nShe recognised Neil\u2019s handwriting.\n\nAlas, String Theory is no longer able to trade in these premises.

God Only Knows What We\u2019ll Be Without You.\n\nDylan was amused. \u2018I see what they did there.\u2019 Then a moment later. \u2018I was named after Bob Dylan. Did I ever tell you that?\u2019\n\n\u2018I can\u2019t remember.\u2019\n\n\u2018You know, the musician.\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes. I have heard of Bob Dylan, Dylan.\u2019\n\n\u2018My older sister is called Suzanne. After the Leonard Cohen song.\u2019\n\nNora smiled. \u2018My parents loved Leonard Cohen.\u2019\n\n\u2018Ever been in there?\u2019 Dylan asked her. \u2018Looked like a great shop.\u2019\n\n\u2018Once or twice.\u2019\n\n\u2018Thought you would have been, what with you being musical. You used to play the piano, didn\u2019t you?\u2019\n\nUsed to.\n\n\u2018Yeah. Keyboards. A little.\u2019\n\nNora saw the notice looked old. She remembered what Neil had said to her. I can\u2019t pay you to put off customers with your face looking like a wet weekend.\n\nWell, Neil, maybe it wasn\u2019t my face after all.\n\nThey carried on walking.\n\n\u2018Dylan, do you believe in parallel universes?\u2019\n\nHe shrugged. \u2018I think so.\u2019\n\n\u2018What do you think you are doing in another life? Do you think this is a good universe? Or would you rather be in a universe where you left Bedford?\u2019\n\n\u2018Not really. I am happy here. Why want another universe if this one has dogs? Dogs are the same here as they are in London. I had a place, you know. I\u2019d got into Glasgow University to do Veterinary Medicine. And I went for a week but I missed my dogs too much. Then my dad lost his job and couldn\u2019t really afford for me to go. So yeah, I never got to be a vet. And I really wanted to be a vet. But I don\u2019t regret it. I have a good life. I\u2019ve got some good friends. I\u2019ve got my dogs.\u2019\n\nNora smiled. She liked Dylan, even if she doubted she could be as attracted to him as this other Nora. He was a good person, and good people were rare.\n\nAs they reached the restaurant, they saw a tall dark-haired man in running gear jogging towards them. It took a disorientating moment for Nora to realise it was Ash \u2013 the Ash who had been a surgeon, the Ash who had been a customer at String Theory and who had asked her out for coffee, the Ash who had comforted her in the hospital and who had knocked on her door, in another world, last night, to tell her that Voltaire was dead. It seemed so recent, that memory, and yet it was hers alone. He was obviously doing some training for the half-marathon on Sunday. There was no reason to believe that the Ash in this life was any different from the one in her root life, except the chances were that he probably hadn\u2019t found a dead Voltaire last night. Or maybe he had, though Voltaire wouldn\u2019t have been called Voltaire.\n\n\u2018Hi,\u2019 she said, forgetting which timeline she was in.\n\nAnd Ash smiled back at her, but it was a confused smile. Confused, but kind, which somehow made Nora feel even more cringey.

If anything, he looked healthier than he had done on her doorstep and, like then, he was wearing running gear \u2013 though here the clothes seemed a bit fancier and more expensive, and he had some kind of fitness tracker attached to his arm.\n\nHe was smiling and holding two cups of coffee, one of which was for Nora. She wondered how many coffees they had shared together, since the first.\n\n\u2018Oh, thank you.\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh no, Nor, did you sleep in here all night?\u2019 he asked.\n\nNor.\n\n\u2018Most of it. I meant to go back to bed but Molly was in a state. I had to calm her and then I was too tired to move.\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh no. I\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t hear her.\u2019 He seemed genuinely sad. \u2018It was probably my fault. I showed her some bears on YouTube yesterday before work.\u2019\n\n\u2018No worries.\u2019\n\n\u2018Anyway, I\u2019ve walked Plato. I\u2019m not in the hospital till midday today. It\u2019s going to be a late one. Are you still wanting to go into the library today?\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh. You know what? I might give it a miss.\u2019\n\n\u2018Okay, well, I got Mol some brekkie and will drop her off at school.\u2019\n\n\u2018I can take Molly,\u2019 said Nora. \u2018If you\u2019ve got a big day.\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh, it\u2019s an okay one. A gall bladder and a pancreas so far. Easy street. Am going to get a run in.\u2019\n\n\u2018Right. Yes. \u2019Course. For the half-marathon on Sunday.\u2019\n\n\u2018What?\u2019\n\n\u2018Nothing. It doesn\u2019t matter,\u2019 Nora said, \u2018I\u2019m just delirious from sleeping on the floor.\u2019\n\n\u2018No worries. Anyway, my sister phoned. They want her to illustrate the calendar for Kew Gardens. Lots of plants. She\u2019s really pleased.\u2019\n\nHe smiled. He seemed happy for this sister of his who Nora had never heard of. She wanted to thank him for being so good about her dead cat, but she obviously couldn\u2019t so she just said, \u2018Thank you.\u2019\n\n\u2018For what?\u2019\n\n\u2018Just, you know, everything.\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh. Right. Okay.\u2019\n\n\u2018So, thank you.\u2019\n\nHe nodded. \u2018That\u2019s nice. Anyway, run time.\u2019\n\nHe drained his coffee and then disappeared. Nora scanned the room, absorbing every new piece of information. Every cuddly toy and book and plug socket, as if they were all part of the jigsaw of her life.\n\nAn hour later, Molly was being dropped off at her infant school and Nora was doing the usual. Checking her emails and social media. Her social media activity wasn\u2019t great in this life, which was always a promising sign, but she did have a hell of a lot of emails. From these emails she divined that she was not simply \u2018stopping\u2019 teaching at the moment but had officially stopped. She was on a sabbatical in order to write a book about Henry David Thoreau and his relevance for the modern-day environmentalist movement. Later in the year she planned to visit Walden Pond in Concord, Massachusetts, funded by a research grant.\n\nThis seemed pretty good.\n\nAlmost annoyingly good.\n\nA good life with a good daughter and a good man in a good house in a good town. It was an excess of good. A life where she could sit down all day reading and researching and writing about her all-time favourite philosopher.\n\n\u2018This is cool,\u2019 she told the dog. \u2018Isn\u2019t this cool?\u2019\n\nPlato yawned indifference.\n\nThen she set about exploring her house, being watched by the Labrador from the comfy-looking sofa. The living room was vast. Her feet sunk into the soft rug.\n\nWhite floorboards, TV, wood-burner, electric piano, two new laptops on charge, a mahogany chest on which perched an ornate chess set, nicely stacked bookshelves. A lovely guitar resting in the corner. Nora recognised the model instantly as an electro-acoustic \u2018Midnight Satin\u2019 Fender Malibu. She had sold one during her last week working at String Theory.\n\nThere were photos in frames dotted around the living room. Kids she didn\u2019t know with a woman who looked like Ash \u2013 presumably his sister. An old photo of her deceased parents on their wedding day, and one of her and Ash getting married. She could see her brother in the background. A photo of Plato. And one of a baby, presumably Molly.\n\nShe glanced at the books. Some yoga manuals, but not the second-hand ones she owned in her root life. Some medical books. She recognised her copy of Bertrand Russell\u2019s History of Western Philosophy, along with Henry David Thoreau\u2019s Walden, both of which she\u2019d owned since university. A familiar Principles of Geology was also there. There were quite a few books on Thoreau. And copies of Plato\u2019s Republic and Hannah Arendt\u2019s The Origins of Totalitarianism, which she did own in her root life, but not in these editions. Intellectual-looking books by people like Julia Kristeva and Judith Butler and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. There were a lot of works on Eastern philosophy that she had never read before and she wondered if she stayed in this life, and she couldn\u2019t see why not, whether there was a way to read them all before she had to do any more teaching at Cambridge.\n\nNovels, some Dickens, The Bell Jar, some geeky pop-science books, a few music books, a few parenting manuals, Nature by Ralph Waldo Emerson and Silent Spring by Rachel Carson, some stuff on climate change, and a large hardback called Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape.\n\nShe had rarely, if ever, been this consistently highbrow. This was clearly what happened when you did a Master\u2019s degree at Cambridge and then went on sabbatical to write a book on your favourite philosopher.\n\n\u2018You\u2019re impressed by me,\u2019 she told the dog. \u2018You can admit it.\u2019\n\nThere was also a pile of music songbooks, and Nora smiled when she saw that the one on top was the Simon & Garfunkel one she had sold to Ash the day he had asked her out for a coffee. On the coffee table there was a nice glossy hardback book of photographs of Spanish scenery and on the sofa there was something called The Encyclopedia of Plants and Flowers.\n\nAnd in the magazine rack there was the brand-new National Geographic with the picture of the black hole on the cover.\n\nThere was a picture on the wall. A Mir\u00f3 print from a museum in Barcelona.\n\n\u2018Have me and Ash been to Barcelona together, Plato?\u2019 She imagined them both, hand-in-hand, wandering the streets of the Gothic Quarter together, popping into a bar for tapas and Rioja.\n\nOn the wall opposite the bookshelves there was a mirror. A broad mirror with an ornate white frame. She no longer got surprised by the variations in appearance between lives. She had been every shape and size and had every haircut. In this life, she looked perfectly pleasant. She would have liked to be friends with this person. It wasn\u2019t an Olympian or a rock star or a Cirque du Soleil acrobat she was looking at, but it was someone who seemed to be having a good life, as far as you could tell these things. A grown-up who had a vague idea of who she was and what she was doing in life. Short hair, but not dramatically so, skin looking healthier than in her root life, either through diet, a lack of red wine, exercise, or the cleansers and moisturisers she\u2019d seen in the bathroom, which were all more expensive than anything she owned in her root life.\n\n\u2018Well,\u2019 she said to Plato. \u2018This is a nice life, yeah?\u2019\n\nPlato seemed to agree."}]}

You\u2019re just a . . . mechanism.\u2019\n\n\u2018Aren\u2019t we all?\u2019\n\n\u2018Not like that.

Books are precious. You have to treat them carefully.\u2019\n\n\u2018But these are other lives. Other variants of me. Not me me.\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, but while you are experiencing them, it is you who has to pay the consequences.\u2019\n\n\u2018Well, I think that stinks, to be perfectly honest.\u2019\n\nThe librarian\u2019s smile curled at its edges, like a fallen leaf. \u2018Well, this is interesting.\u2019\n\n\u2018What is interesting?\u2019\n\n\u2018The fact that you have so thoroughly changed your attitude towards dying.\u2019\n\n\u2018What?\u2019\n\n\u2018You wanted to die and now you don\u2019t.\u2019\n\nIt dawned on Nora that Mrs Elm might be close to having a point, although not quite the whole point. \u2018Well, I still think my actual life isn\u2019t worth living. In fact, this experience has just managed to confirm that.\u2019\n\nShe shook her head. \u2018I don\u2019t think you think that.\u2019\n\n\u2018I do think that. That\u2019s why I said it.\u2019\n\n\u2018No. The Book of Regrets is getting lighter. There\u2019s a lot of white space in there now . . . It seems that you have spent all your life saying things that you aren\u2019t really thinking. This is one of your barriers.\u2019\n\n\u2018Barriers?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes. You have a lot of them. They stop you from seeing the truth.\u2019\n\n\u2018About what?\u2019\n\n\u2018About yourself. And you really need to start trying. To see the truth. Because this matters.\u2019\n\n\u2018I thought there were an infinite number of lives to choose from.\u2019\n\n\u2018You need to pick the life you\u2019d be most happy inside. Or soon there won\u2019t be a choice at all.\u2019\n\n\u2018I met someone who has been doing this for a long time and he still hasn\u2019t found a life that he is satisfied with . . .\u2019\n\n\u2018Well, Hugo\u2019s is a privilege you might not have.\u2019\n\n\u2018Hugo? How do you\u2014\u2019\n\nBut then she remembered Mrs Elm knew a lot more than she should.\n\n\u2018You need to choose carefully,\u2019 continued the librarian. \u2018One day the library may not be here and you\u2019ll be gone for ever.\u2019\n\n\u2018How many lives do I have?\u2019\n\n\u2018This isn\u2019t a magic lamp and I am no genie. There is no set number. It could be one. It could be a hundred. But you only have an infinite number of lives to choose from so long as the time in the Midnight Library stays, well, at midnight. Because while it stays at midnight, your life \u2013 your root life \u2013 is somewhere between life and death. If time moves here, that means something very . . .\u2019 She searched for a delicate word. \u2018. . . decisive has happened. Something that razes the Midnight Library to the ground, and takes us with it. And so I would err on the side of caution. I would try to think very keenly about where you want to be. You have clearly made some progress, I can tell. You seem to realise that life could be worth living, if only you found the right one to exist inside. But you don\u2019t want that gate to close before you get a chance to go through it.\u2019\n\nThey both were silent for a very long time, as Nora observed all the books all around her. All the possibilities. Calmly and slowly, she walked along the aisle, wondering what lay beyond the covers of each book, and wishing the green spines would offer some kind of clue.\n\n\u2018Now, which book do you fancy?\u2019 came Mrs Elm\u2019s words behind her.\n\nNora remembered Hugo\u2019s words in the kitchen.\n\nDream big.\n\nThe librarian had a penetrating gaze. \u2018Who is Nora Seed? And what does she want?\u2019\n\nWhen Nora thought of her closest access to happiness, it was music. Yes, she still played the piano and keyboard sometimes, but she had given up creating. She had given up singing. She thought of those happy early pub gigs playing \u2018Beautiful Sky\u2019. She thought of her brother larking about on stage with her and Ravi and Ella.\n\nSo now she knew precisely which book to ask for."}]}

That was the first observation. Her body was coursing with adrenaline and her clothes were clinging to her. There were people around her, a couple of whom had guitars. She could hear noise. Vast, powerful human noise \u2013 a roar of life slowly finding rhythm and shape. Becoming a chant.\n\nThere was a woman in front of her, towelling her face.\n\n\u2018Thanks,\u2019 Nora said, smiling.\n\nThe woman looked startled, as if she\u2019d just been spoken to by a god.\n\nShe recognised a man holding drumsticks. It was Ravi. His hair was dyed white-blonde and he was dressed in a sharp-cut indigo suit with a bare chest where his shirt should have been. He looked an entirely different person to the one who had been looking at the music magazines in the newsagent\u2019s in Bedford only yesterday, or the corporate-looking guy in the blue shirt who had sat watching her do her catastrophic talk in the InterContinental Hotel.\n\n\u2018Ravi,\u2019 she said, \u2018you look amazing!\u2019\n\n\u2018What?\u2019\n\nHe hadn\u2019t heard her over the noise, but now she had a different question.\n\n\u2018Where is Joe?\u2019 she asked, almost as a shout.\n\nRavi looked momentarily confused, or scared, and Nora braced herself for some terrible truth. But none came.\n\n\u2018The usual, I reckon. Schmoozing it up with the foreign press.\u2019\n\nNora had no idea what was going on. He seemed to be still part of the band, but also not in the band enough to be performing on stage with them. And if he wasn\u2019t in the band, then whatever had caused him to leave the band hadn\u2019t caused him to disappear completely. From what Ravi said, and the way he said it, Joe was still very much part of the team. Ella wasn\u2019t there, though. On bass was a large muscly man with a shaved head and tattoos. She wanted to know more, but now was clearly not the time.\n\nRavi swept his hand through the air, gesturing towards what Nora could now see was a very large stage.\n\nShe was overwhelmed. She didn\u2019t know what to feel.\n\n\u2018Encore time,\u2019 said Ravi.\n\nNora tried to think. It had been a long time since she had performed anything. And even then it was only in front of a crowd of about twelve uninterested people in a pub basement.\n\nRavi leaned in. \u2018You okay, Nora?\u2019\n\nIt seemed a bit brittle. The way he said her name seemed to contain the same kind of resentment she\u2019d heard when she\u2019d bumped into him yesterday, in that very different life.\n\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 she said, full shouting now. \u2018Of course. It\u2019s just . . . I have no idea what we should do for the encore.\u2019\n\nRavi shrugged. \u2018Same as always.\u2019\n\n\u2018Hmm. Yeah. Right.\u2019 Nora tried to think. She looked out at the stage. She saw a giant video screen with the words THE LABYRINTHS flashing and rotating out to the roaring crowd. Wow, she thought. We\u2019re big. Proper, stadium-level big. She saw a keyboard and the stool she had been sitting at. Her bandmates whose names she didn\u2019t know were about to walk back on stage.\n\n\u2018Where are we again?\u2019 she asked, above the crowd noise. \u2018I\u2019ve gone blank.\u2019\n\nThe big shaven-headed guy holding the bass told her: \u2018S\u00e3o Paulo.\u2019\n\n\u2018We\u2019re in Brazil?\u2019\n\nThey looked at her as if she was mad.\n\n\u2018Where have you been the last four days?\u2019\n\n\u2018\u201cBeautiful Sky\u201d,\u2019 said Nora, realising she could probably still remember most of the words. \u2018Let\u2019s do that.\u2019\n\n\u2018Again?\u2019 Ravi laughed, his face shining with sweat. \u2018We did it ten minutes ago.\u2019\n\n\u2018Okay. Listen,\u2019 said Nora, her voice now a shout over the crowd demanding an encore. \u2018I was thinking we do something different. Mix it up. I wondered if we could do a different song to usual.\u2019\n\n\u2018We have to do \u201cHowl\u201d,\u2019 said the other band member. A turquoise lead guitar strapped around her. \u2018We always do \u201cHowl\u201d.\u2019\n\nNora had never heard of \u2018Howl\u2019 in her life.\n\n\u2018Yeah, I know,\u2019 she bluffed, \u2018but let\u2019s mix it up. Let\u2019s do something they aren\u2019t expecting. Let\u2019s surprise them.\u2019\n\n\u2018You\u2019re overthinking this, Nora,\u2019 said Ravi.\n\n\u2018I have no other type of thinking available.\u2019\n\nRavi shrugged. \u2018So, what should we do?\u2019\n\nNora struggled to think. She thought of Ash \u2013 with his Simon & Garfunkel guitar songbook. \u2018Let\u2019s do \u201cBridge Over Troubled Water\u201d.\u2019\n\nRavi was incredulous. \u2018What?\u2019\n\n\u2018I think we should do that. It will surprise people.\u2019\n\n\u2018I love that song,\u2019 said the female bandmate. \u2018And I know it.\u2019\n\n\u2018Everyone knows it, Imani,\u2019 Ravi said, dismissively.\n\n\u2018Exactly,\u2019 Nora said, trying her hardest to sound like a rock star, \u2018let\u2019s do it.\u2019"}]}

The power of fame. Like those pop icons she had seen on social media, who could say a single word and get a million likes and shares. Total fame was when you reached the point where looking like a hero, or genius, or god, required minimal effort. But the flipside was that it was precarious. It could be equally easy to fall and look like a devil or a villain, or just an arse.\n\nHer heart raced, as if she were about to set foot on a tight-rope.\n\nShe could see some of the faces in the crowd now, thousands of them, emerging from the dark. Tiny and strange, the clothed bodies almost invisible. She was staring out at twenty thousand disembodied heads.\n\nHer mouth was dry. She could hardly speak, so wondered how she was going to sing.

They screamed and roared and clapped and chanted. The response was phenomenal. She felt, momentarily, like Cleopatra. An utterly terrified Cleopatra.\n\nAdjusting her hands into position for E-flat major, she was momentarily distracted by a tattoo on her weirdly hairless forearm, written in beautifully angled calligraphic letters. It was a quote from Henry David Thoreau. All good things are wild and free. She closed her eyes and vowed not to open them until she had finished the song.\n\nShe understood why Chopin had liked playing in the dark so much. It was so much easier that way.\n\nWild, she thought to herself. Free.\n\nAs she sang, she felt alive. Even more alive than she had felt swimming in her Olympic-champion body.\n\nShe wondered why she had been so scared of this, of singing to a crowd. It was a great feeling.\n\nRavi came over to her at the end of the song, while they were still on stage. \u2018That was fucking special, man,\u2019 he shouted in her ear.\n\n\u2018Oh good,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018Now let\u2019s kill this and do \u201cHowl\u201d.\u2019\n\nShe shook her head, then spoke into the microphone, hurriedly, before anyone else had a chance to. \u2018Thank you for coming, everybody! I really hope you all had a nice evening. Get home safely.\u2019\n\n\u2018Get home safely?\u2019 Ravi said in the coach on the way back to the hotel. She hadn\u2019t remembered him being such an arse. He seemed unhappy.\n\n\u2018What was wrong with that?\u2019 she wondered out loud.\n\n\u2018Hardly your normal style.\u2019\n\n\u2018Wasn\u2019t it?\u2019\n\n\u2018Well, bit of a contrast to Chicago.\u2019\n\n\u2018Why? What did I do in Chicago?\u2019\n\nRavi laughed. \u2018Have you been lobotomised?\u2019\n\nShe looked at her phone. In this life she had the latest model.\n\nA message from Izzy.\n\nIt was the same message she\u2019d had in her life with Dan, in the pub. Not a message at all but a photo of a whale. Actually, it might have been a slightly different photo of a whale. That was interesting. Why was she still friends with Izzy in this life and not in her root life? After all, she was pretty sure she wasn\u2019t married to Dan in this life. She checked her hand and was relieved to see a totally naked ring finger.\n\nNora supposed it was because she had already been super-famous with The Labyrinths before Izzy decided to go to Australia, so Nora\u2019s decision not to go may have been more understandable. Or maybe Izzy just liked the idea of a famous friend.\n\nIzzy wrote something under the picture of the whale.\n\nAll good things are wild and free.\n\nShe must have known about the tattoo.\n\nAnother message came through now from her.\n\n\u2018Hope Brazil was a blast. Am sure you rocked it! And thanks ten million for sorting out the tix for Brisbane. Am totally stoked. As we Gold Coasters say.\u2019\n\nThere were a few emojis of whales and hearts and thanking hands and a microphone and some musical notes.\n\nNora checked her Instagram. In this life she had 11.3 million followers.\n\nAnd bloody hell, she looked amazing. Her naturally black hair had a kind of white stripe in it. Vampiric make-up. And a lip piercing. She did look tired but she supposed that was just a result of living on tour. It was a glamorous kind of tired. Like Billie Eilish\u2019s cool aunt.\n\nShe took a selfie and saw that while she didn\u2019t look exactly like the excessively styled and filtered photos on her feed, which had been for magazine shoots, she did look cooler than she ever imagined she could look. As with her Australian life, she also put poems up online. The difference with this life, though, was that each poem had about half a million likes. One of the poems was even called \u2018Fire\u2019 but it was different to the other one.\n\nShe had a fire inside her.\n\nShe wondered if the fire was to warm her or destroy her.\n\nThen she realised.\n\nA fire had no motive.\n\nOnly she could have that.\n\nThe power was hers.\n\nA woman sat next to her. This woman wasn\u2019t in the band, but she exuded importance. She was about fifty years old. Maybe she was the manager. Maybe she worked for the record company. She had the air of a strict mum about her. But she began with a smile.\n\n\u2018Stroke of genius,\u2019 she said. \u2018The Simon & Garfunkel thing. You\u2019re trending across South America.\u2019\n\n\u2018Cool.\u2019\n\n\u2018Have posted about it from your accounts.\u2019\n\nShe\u2019d said this like it was a perfectly normal thing. \u2018Oh. Right. Okay.\u2019\n\n\u2018There\u2019s a couple of last-minute press things tonight at the hotel. Then tomorrow it\u2019s an early start . . . We fly to Rio first thing, then eight hours of press. All at the hotel.\u2019\n\n\u2018Rio?\u2019\n\n\u2018You\u2019re up to speed with this week\u2019s tour schedule, right?\u2019\n\n\u2018Um, kind of. Could you just remind me again?\u2019\n\nShe sighed, with good humour, as if Nora not knowing the tour schedule was totally in character. \u2018Sure. Rio tomorrow. Two nights. Then the final night in Brazil \u2013 Porto Alegre \u2013 then Santiago, Chile, Buenos Aires, then Lima. And that\u2019s the last leg of South America. Then next week it\u2019s the start of the Asia leg \u2013 Japan, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Taiwan.\u2019\n\n\u2018Peru? We\u2019re famous in Peru?\u2019\n\n\u2018Nora, you\u2019ve been to Peru before, remember? Last year. They went out of their minds. All fifteen thousand of them. It\u2019s at the same place. The racecourse.\u2019\n\n\u2018The racecourse. Sure. Yeah. I remember. Was a good night. Really . . . good.\u2019\n\nThat\u2019s what this life probably felt like, she realised. One big racecourse. But she had no idea if she was the horse or the jockey in that analogy.\n\nRavi tapped the woman on the shoulder. \u2018Joanna, what time\u2019s that podcast tomorrow?\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh damn. Actually, it\u2019s tonight now. Timings. Sorry. Forgot to say. But they only really have to speak to Nora. So you can get an early night if you want.\u2019\n\nRavi shrugged, dejected. \u2018Sure. Yeah.\u2019\n\nJoanna sighed. \u2018Don\u2019t shoot the messenger. Though it\u2019s never stopped you before.\u2019\n\nNora wondered again where her brother was, but the tension between Joanna and Ravi made it feel wrong to ask something she should so obviously know. So she stared out of the window as the coach drove along the four-lane highway. The glowing tail-lights of cars and lorries and motorbikes in the dark, like red and watching eyes. Distant skyscrapers with a few tiny squares of light against a humid backdrop of dark sky and darker clouds. A shadowy army of trees lined the sides and middle of the highway, splitting the traffic into two directions.\n\nIf she was still in this life tomorrow evening, she would be expected to perform an entire concert\u2019s worth of songs, most of which she didn\u2019t actually know. She wondered how quickly she could learn the set list.\n\nHer phone rang. A video call. The caller was \u2018Ryan\u2019.\n\nJoanna saw the name and smirked a little. \u2018You\u2019d better get that.\u2019\n\nSo she did, even though she had no idea who this Ryan was, and the image on the screen seemed too blurry to recognise.\n\nBut then he was there. A face she had seen, in movies and imaginings, many times.\n\n\u2018Hey, babe. Just checking in with a friend. We\u2019re still friends, right?\u2019\n\nShe knew the voice too.\n\nAmerican, rugged, charming. Famous.\n\nShe heard Joanna whispering to someone else on the coach: \u2018She\u2019s on the phone to Ryan Bailey.\u2019"}]}

They didn\u2019t seem too bothered about the other band members but they did seem desperate to interact with Nora.\n\nShe looked at one, as she crunched over the gravel towards them. The girl had tattoos and was wearing an outfit that made her look like a flapper girl who had somehow got caught up in a cyberpunk version of a post-apocalyptic war. Her hair was styled exactly like Nora\u2019s, complete with matching white stripe.\n\n\u2018Nora! Noraaaah! Hi! We love you, queen! Thank you for coming to Brazil! You rock!\u2019 And then a chant started: \u2018Nora! Nora! Nora!\u2019\n\nWhile she was signing autographs in an illegible scribble, a man in his early twenties took off his T-shirt and asked her to sign his shoulder.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s for a tattoo,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018Really?\u2019 she asked, writing her name onto the man\u2019s body.\n\n\u2018This is the highlight of my life,\u2019 he gushed. \u2018My name is Francisco.\u2019\n\nNora wondered how her writing on his skin with a Sharpie could be a highlight of his existence.\n\n\u2018You saved my life. \u201cBeautiful Sky\u201d saved my life. That song. It\u2019s so powerful.\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh. Oh wow. \u201cBeautiful Sky\u201d? You know \u201cBeautiful Sky\u201d?\u2019\n\nThe fan burst into hysterics. \u2018You\u2019re so funny! This is why you are my idol! I love you so much! Do I know \u201cBeautiful Sky\u201d? That\u2019s brilliant!\u2019\n\nNora didn\u2019t know what to say. That little song she had written when she was nineteen years old at university in Bristol had changed the life of a person in Brazil. It was overwhelming.\n\nThis, clearly, was the life she was destined for. She doubted that she would ever have to go back to the library. She could cope with being adored. It was better than being in Bedford, sitting on the number 77 bus, humming sad tunes to the window.\n\nShe posed for selfies.\n\nOne young woman looked close to tears. She had a large photo of Nora kissing Ryan Bailey.\n\n\u2018I was so sad when you broke up with him!\u2019\n\n\u2018I know, yeah, it was sad. But, you know, things happen. It\u2019s a . . . learning curve.\u2019\n\nJoanna appeared at her arm and gently guided her away, towards the hotel.\n\nWhen she reached the elegant, jasmine-scented lobby (marble, chandeliers, floral displays) she saw that the rest of the band were already in the bar. But where was her brother? Maybe he\u2019d been schmoozing the press somewhere else.\n\nAs she started to move towards the bar, she realised that everyone \u2013 concierge, receptionists, guests \u2013 was looking at her.\n\nNora was about to finally seize the opportunity to ask about her brother\u2019s whereabouts when Joanna beckoned over a man who was wearing a T-shirt with THE LABYRINTHS printed on it in a retro sci-fi movie font. The guy was probably in his forties, with a greying beard and thinning hair, but he seemed intimidated by Nora\u2019s presence. He did a tiny bow when he shook Nora\u2019s hand.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m Marcelo,\u2019 he said. \u2018Thanks for agreeing to the interview.\u2019\n\nNora noticed another man behind Marcelo \u2013 younger, with piercings, tattoos and a big smile \u2013 holding recording equipment.\n\n\u2018We\u2019d reserved a quiet space in the bar,\u2019 Joanna said. \u2018But there\u2019s . . . people. I think we had better do this in Nora\u2019s suite.\u2019\n\n\u2018Great,\u2019 said Marcelo. \u2018Great, great.\u2019\n\nAs they walked over to the lift, Nora glanced back at the bar and saw the other band members. \u2018You know, maybe you\u2019d like to speak to the others too?\u2019 she said to Marcelo. \u2018They remember things I don\u2019t. A lot of things.\u2019\n\nMarcelo smiled and shook his head and delicately said, \u2018It works better this way, I feel . . .\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh, okay,\u2019 she said.\n\nEvery eye was on them as they waited for the lift to arrive. Joanna leaned into Nora.\n\n\u2018Are you okay?\u2019\n\n\u2018Of course. Yeah. Why?\u2019\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just, you seem different tonight.\u2019\n\n\u2018Different how?\u2019\n\n\u2018Just . . . different.\u2019\n\nAs they got in the lift Joanna asked another woman, one Nora recognised from the coach, to bring some drinks from the bar \u2013 two beers for the podcasters, a sparkling mineral water for Nora and a caipirinha for herself.\n\n\u2018And bring them up to the suite, Maya.\u2019\n\nMaybe I am teetotal in this life, thought Nora, as she walked out of the lift and along the plush salmon-pink carpet to her suite.\n\nAnd then, as she entered it, she tried to act like this was all perfectly normal. This gigantic room, leading to another gigantic room, leading to a gigantic bathroom. There was a vast bouquet of flowers for her, with a note signed by the hotel\u2019s manager.\n\nWow, she resisted saying, as she gazed around at the lavish furnishings, the sweeping floor-to-ceiling curtains, the pristine white bed the size of an acre, the TV the size of a small cinema, the champagne on ice, the silver tray full of \u2018Brazilian honey cakes\u2019 as the card informed them.\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ll be having any of these,\u2019 said Joanna, taking one of the little delicacies from the tray. \u2018Now you\u2019re on that new plan. Harley said I had to keep an eye on you.\u2019\n\nNora watched Joanna bite into one of the cakes and wondered how good any plan could be if it didn\u2019t involve eating something so clearly delicious as a Brazilian honey cake. She had no idea who Harley was, but she knew she didn\u2019t like them.\n\n\u2018Also . . . just so you know, the fires are still going on in LA and they\u2019re evacuating half of Calabasas now, but hopefully it won\u2019t get as high as your place . . .\u2019\n\nNora didn\u2019t know whether to be pleased at the idea of having a house in LA, or worried that it was about to go on fire.\n\nThe two Brazilian podcast guys took a few moments to set up their equipment. And Nora sunk herself into the vast sofa in the living area as Joanna \u2013 attending to a few rogue crumbs around her mouth with a heavily manicured finger \u2013 explained that their music podcast, O Som, was the most popular in Brazil.\n\n\u2018Great demographics,\u2019 Joanna enthused. \u2018And the numbers are stratospheric. It\u2019s totally worth doing.\u2019\n\nAnd she stayed there, watching like a hawk mother, as the podcast began."}]}

It has been quite a ride,\u2019 said Nora, trying to sound like a rock star.\n\n\u2018Now, if I may ask about the album . . . Pottersville. You wrote all the lyrics, yes?\u2019\n\n\u2018Mostly, yes,\u2019 Nora guessed, staring at the small, familiar mole on her left hand.\n\n\u2018She wrote all of them,\u2019 interjected Joanna.\n\nMarcelo nodded while the other guy, still smiling toothily, fiddled about with sound levels via a laptop.\n\n\u2018I think \u201cFeathers\u201d is my favourite track,\u2019 said Marcelo, as the drinks arrived.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m glad you like it.\u2019\n\nNora tried to think of a way she could get out of this interview. A headache? A bad stomach?\n\n\u2018But the one I\u2019d like to talk about first is the first one you decided to release. \u201cStay Out Of My Life\u201d. It seemed such a personal statement.\u2019\n\nNora forced a smile. \u2018The lyrics say it all really.\u2019\n\n\u2018Obviously there has been some speculation about whether it refers to the . . . how do you say it in English?\u2019\n\n\u2018Restraining order?\u2019 offered Joanna, helpfully.\n\n\u2018Yes! The restraining order.\u2019\n\n\u2018Um,\u2019 said Nora, taken aback. \u2018Well. I prefer to get it all out in the song. I find that stuff difficult to talk about.\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, I understand. It is just that in your recent Rolling Stone interview you talked a little about your former boyfriend, Dan Lord, and mentioned how difficult it was to get the . . . the . . . the restraining order against him, after he stalked you . . . Didn\u2019t he try to break into your house? Then tell reporters that he wrote the lyrics for \u201cBeautiful Sky\u201d?\u2019\n\n\u2018Jesus.\u2019\n\nShe hovered at the intersection of tears and laughter, and managed, somehow, to give neither.\n\n\u2018I wrote it when I was still with him. But he didn\u2019t like it. He didn\u2019t like me being in this band. He hated it. He hated my brother. He hated Ravi. He hated Ella, who was one of the original members. Anyway, Dan was very jealous.\u2019\n\nThis was so surreal. In one life, the life he\u2019d supposedly wanted, Dan was so bored in his marriage to Nora he was having an affair, while in this life he was breaking into her house because he couldn\u2019t stand her success.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s a dick,\u2019 said Nora. \u2018I don\u2019t know the Portuguese swear word for a terrible person.\u2019\n\n\u2018Cabr\u00e3o. It means someone\u2019s a dick.\u2019\n\n\u2018Or an asshole,\u2019 the younger guy added, stone-faced.\n\n\u2018Yeah, well, he\u2019s a cabr\u00e3o. He turned out to be someone else entirely. It\u2019s weird. The way when your life changes people act in different ways. The price of fame, I suppose.\u2019\n\n\u2018And you wrote a song called \u201cHenry David Thoreau\u201d. You don\u2019t get many songs named after philosophers . . .\u2019\n\n\u2018I know. Well, when I studied Philosophy at university, he was my favourite. Hence my tattoo. And it made a marginally better song title than \u201cImmanuel Kant\u201d.\u2019\n\nShe was getting into the swing of it now. It wasn\u2019t too hard to act a life when it was the one she was destined for.\n\n\u2018And \u201cHowl\u201d, obviously. Such a powerful song. Number one in twenty-two countries. Grammy award-winning video with a Hollywood A-list cast. I suppose you are done talking about it?\u2019\n\n\u2018I suppose, yes.\u2019\n\nJoanna went to get herself another honey cake.\n\nMarcelo smiled, gently, as he pressed on. \u2018For me it seemed so primal. The song, I mean. Like you were letting everything out. And then I discovered you wrote it on the very night you fired your last manager. Before Joanna. After you found out he\u2019d been ripping you off . . .\u2019\n\n\u2018Yeah. That wasn\u2019t good,\u2019 she improvised. \u2018It was such a betrayal.\u2019\n\n\u2018I was a big Labyrinths fan before \u201cHowl\u201d. But that was the one for me. That and \u201cLighthouse Girl\u201d. \u201cHowl\u201d was where I was like, Nora Seed is a genius. The lyrics are pretty abstract, but the way you just let out that rage was so soft and soulful and powerful all at once. It\u2019s like early Cure fused with Frank Ocean via The Carpenters and Tame Impala.\u2019\n\nNora tried, and failed, to imagine what that could possibly sound like.\n\nHe started to sing, to everyone\u2019s surprise: \u2018\u201cSilence the music to improve the tune / Stop the fake smiles and howl at the moon\u201d.\u2019\n\nNora smiled and nodded, as if she knew these lyrics. \u2018Yeah. Yeah. I was just . . . howling.\u2019\n\nMarcelo\u2019s face became serious. He seemed genuinely concerned for her. \u2018You\u2019ve had so much shit to deal with these last few years. Stalkers, bad managers, the fake feuds, the court case, the copyright issues, the messy break-up with Ryan Bailey, the reception of the last album, rehab, that incident in Toronto . . . that time you collapsed from exhaustion in Paris, personal tragedy, drama drama drama. And all that media intrusion. Why do you think the press hate you so much?\u2019\n\nNora began to feel a bit queasy. Was this what fame was like? Like a permanent bittersweet cocktail of worship and assault? It was no wonder so many famous people went off the rails when the rails veered in every direction. It was like being slapped and kissed at the same time.\n\n\u2018I . . . I don\u2019t know . . . it\u2019s pretty crackers . . .\u2019\n\n\u2018I mean, do you ever wonder what your life would have been like if you had decided to take a different path?\u2019\n\nNora listened to this as she stared at the bubbles rising in her mineral water.\n\n\u2018I think it is easy to imagine there are easier paths,\u2019 she said, realising something for the first time. \u2018But maybe there are no easy paths. There are just paths. In one life, I might be married. In another, I might be working in a shop. I might have said yes to this cute guy who asked me out for a coffee. In another I might be researching glaciers in the Arctic Circle. In another, I might be an Olympic swimming champion. Who knows? Every second of every day we are entering a new universe. And we spend so much time wishing our lives were different, comparing ourselves to other people and to other versions of ourselves, when really most lives contain degrees of good and degrees of bad.\u2019\n\nMarcelo and Joanna and the other Brazilian guy were staring at her wide-eyed, but she was on a roll now. Freewheeling.\n\n\u2018There are patterns to life . . . Rhythms. It is so easy, while trapped in just the one life, to imagine that times of sadness or tragedy or failure or fear are a result of that particular existence. That it is a by-product of living a certain way, rather than simply living. I mean, it would have made things a lot easier if we understood there was no way of living that can immunise you against sadness. And that sadness is intrinsically part of the fabric of happiness. You can\u2019t have one without the other. Of course, they come in different degrees and quantities. But there is no life where you can be in a state of sheer happiness for ever. And imagining there is just breeds more unhappiness in the life you\u2019re in.\u2019\n\n\u2018That is a great answer,\u2019 Marcelo said, after he was sure she was finished. \u2018But tonight I would say, at the concert, you seemed happy. When you played \u201cBridge Over Troubled Water\u201d instead of \u201cHowl\u201d, that was such a powerful statement. It was saying: I am strong. It felt like you were telling us, your fans, that you were okay. And so, how is touring going?\u2019\n\n\u2018Well, it\u2019s great. And yes, I just thought I\u2019d send a message that, you know, I am out here living my best life. But I miss home after a while.\u2019\n\n\u2018Which one?\u2019 asked Marcelo, with a quietly cheeky smile. \u2018I mean, do you feel more at home in London, or LA, or on the Amalfi Coast?\u2019\n\nIt seemed this was the life where her carbon footprint was the highest.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know. I suppose I would say London.\u2019\n\nMarcelo took a sharp intake of breath, as if the next question was something he had to swim under. He scratched his beard. \u2018Okay, but I suppose it must be hard for you, as I know you shared that flat with your brother?\u2019\n\n\u2018Why would it be hard?\u2019\n\nJoanna gave her a curious glance from above her cocktail.\n\nMarcelo looked at her with sentimental fondness. His eyes seemed glazed. \u2018I mean,\u2019 he went on, after a delicate sip of beer, \u2018your brother was such a big part of your life, such a big part of the band . . .\u2019\n\nWas.\n\nSo much dread in such a small word. Like a stone falling through water.\n\nShe remembered asking Ravi about her brother before the encore. She remembered the crowd\u2019s reaction when she had mentioned her brother on stage.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s still around. He was here tonight.\u2019\n\n\u2018She means she feels him,\u2019 said Joanna. \u2018They all feel him. He was such a strong spirit. Troubled, but strong . . . It was a tragedy how the drink and drugs and the whole life got to him in the end . . .\u2019\n\n\u2018What are you talking about?\u2019 Nora asked. She was no longer acting a life. She genuinely needed to know.\n\nMarcelo looked sad for her. \u2018You know, it\u2019s only been two years since his death . . . his overdose . . .\u2019\n\nNora gasped.\n\nShe didn\u2019t arrive back in the library instantly because she hadn\u2019t absorbed it. She stood up, dazed, and staggered out of the suite.\n\n\u2018Nora?\u2019 laughed Joanna, nervously. \u2018Nora?\u2019\n\nShe got in the lift and went down to the bar. To Ravi.\n\n\u2018You said Joe was schmoozing the media.\u2019\n\n\u2018What?\u2019\n\n\u2018You said. I asked you what Joe was doing and you said, \u201cschmoozing the media\u201d.\u2019\n\nHe put his beer down and stared at her like a riddle. \u2018And I was right. She was schmoozing the media.\u2019\n\n\u2018She?\u2019\n\nHe pointed over to Joanna, who was looking aghast as she headed over from the lifts in the lobby.\n\n\u2018Yeah. Jo. She was with the press.\u2019\n\nAnd Nora felt the sadness like a punch.\n\n\u2018Oh no,\u2019 she said. \u2018Oh Joe . . . oh Joe . . . oh . . .\u2019\n\nAnd the grand hotel bar disappeared. The table, the drinks, Joanna, Marcelo, the sound guy, the hotel guests, Ravi, the others, the marble floor, the barman, the waiters, the chandeliers, the flowers, all became nothing at all."}]}

It is still a library. If you are in a cathedral, you are quiet because you are in a cathedral, not because other people are there. It\u2019s the same with a library.\u2019\n\n\u2018Okay,\u2019 Nora said, in a lower voice. \u2018I don\u2019t like this. I want it to stop. I want to cancel my membership of the library. I would like to hand in my library card.\u2019\n\n\u2018You are the library card.\u2019\n\nNora returned to her original point. \u2018I want it to stop.\u2019\n\n\u2018No you don\u2019t.\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes I do.\u2019\n\n\u2018Then why are you still here?\u2019\n\n\u2018Because I have no choice.\u2019\n\n\u2018Trust me, Nora. If you really didn\u2019t want to be here, you wouldn\u2019t be here. I told you this right at the start.\u2019\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t like it.\u2019\n\n\u2018Why?\u2019\n\n\u2018Because it is too painful.\u2019\n\n\u2018Why is it painful?\u2019\n\n\u2018Because it\u2019s real. In one life, my brother is dead.\u2019\n\nThe librarian\u2019s face became stern again. \u2018And in one life \u2013 one of his lives \u2013 you are dead. Will that be painful for him?\u2019\n\n\u2018I doubt it. He doesn\u2019t want anything to do with me these days. He has his own life and he blames me that it is unfulfilled.\u2019\n\n\u2018So, this is all about your brother?\u2019\n\n\u2018No. It\u2019s about everything. It seems impossible to live without hurting people.\u2019\n\n\u2018That\u2019s because it is.\u2019\n\n\u2018So why live at all?\u2019\n\n\u2018Well, in fairness, dying hurts people too. Now, what life do you want to choose next?\u2019\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t.\u2019\n\n\u2018What?\u2019\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t want another book. I don\u2019t want another life.\u2019\n\nMrs Elm\u2019s face went pale, like it had done all those years ago when she\u2019d got the call about Nora\u2019s dad.\n\nNora felt a trembling beneath her feet. A minor earthquake. She and Mrs Elm held onto the shelves as books fell to the floor. The lights flickered and then went dark completely. The chessboard and table tipped over.\n\n\u2018Oh no,\u2019 said Mrs Elm. \u2018Not again.\u2019\n\n\u2018What\u2019s the matter?\u2019\n\n\u2018You know what the matter is. This whole place exists because of you. You are the power source. When there is a severe disruption in that power source the library is in jeopardy. It\u2019s you, Nora. You are giving up at the worst possible moment. You can\u2019t give up, Nora. You have more to offer. More opportunities to have. There are so many versions of you out there. Remember how you felt after the polar bear. Remember how much you wanted life.\u2019\n\nThe polar bear.\n\nThe polar bear.\n\n\u2018Even these bad experiences are serving a purpose, don\u2019t you see?\u2019\n\nShe saw. The regrets she had been living with most of her life were wasted ones.\n\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\nThe minor earthquake subsided.\n\nBut there were books scattered everywhere, all over the floor.\n\nThe lights had come back on, but still flickered.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 said Nora. She started trying to pick up the books and put them back in place.\n\n\u2018No,\u2019 snapped Mrs Elm. \u2018Don\u2019t touch them. Put them down.\u2019\n\n\u2018Sorry.\u2019\n\n\u2018And stop saying sorry. Now, you can help me with this. This is safer.\u2019\n\nShe helped Mrs Elm pick up the chess pieces and set up the board for a new game, putting the table back in place too.\n\n\u2018What about all the books on the floor? Are we just going to leave them?\u2019\n\n\u2018Why do you care? I thought you wanted them to disappear completely?\u2019\n\nMrs Elm may well have just been a mechanism that existed in order to simplify the intricate complexity of the quantum universe, but right now \u2013 sitting down between the half-empty bookshelves near her chessboard, set up for a new game \u2013 she looked sad and wise and infinitely human.\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t mean to be so harsh,\u2019 Mrs Elm managed, eventually.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s okay.\u2019\n\n\u2018I remember when we started playing chess in the school library, you used to lose your best players straight away,\u2019 she said. \u2018You\u2019d go and get the queen or the rooks right out there, and they\u2019d be gone. And then you would act like the game was lost because you were just left with pawns and a knight or two.\u2019\n\n\u2018Why are you mentioning this now?\u2019\n\nMrs Elm saw a loose thread on her cardigan and tucked it inside her sleeve, then decided against it and let it loose again.\n\n\u2018You need to realise something if you are ever to succeed at chess,\u2019 she said, as if Nora had nothing bigger to think about. \u2018And the thing you need to realise is this: the game is never over until it is over. It isn\u2019t over if there is a single pawn still on the board. If one side is down to a pawn and a king, and the other side has every player, there is still a game. And even if you were a pawn \u2013 maybe we all are \u2013 then you should remember that a pawn is the most magical piece of all. It might look small and ordinary but it isn\u2019t. Because a pawn is never just a pawn. A pawn is a queen-in-waiting. All you need to do is find a way to keep moving forward. One square after another. And you can get to the other side and unlock all kinds of power.\u2019\n\nNora stared at the books around her. \u2018So, are you saying I only have pawns to play with?\u2019\n\n\u2018I am saying that the thing that looks the most ordinary might end up being the thing that leads you to victory. You have to keep going. Like that day in the river. Do you remember?\u2019\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nHow old had she been? Must have been seventeen, as she was no longer swimming in competitions. It was a fraught period in which her dad was cross with her all the time and her mum was going through one of her near-mute depression patches. Her brother was back from art college for the weekend with Ravi. Showing his friend the sights of glorious Bedford. Joe had arranged an impromptu party by the river, with music and beer and a ton of weed and girls who were frustrated Joe wasn\u2019t interested in them. Nora had been invited and drank too much and somehow got talking to Ravi about swimming.\n\n\u2018So, could you swim the river?\u2019 he asked her.\n\n\u2018Sure.\u2019\n\n\u2018No you couldn\u2019t,\u2019 someone else had said.\n\nAnd so, in a moment of idiocy, she had decided to prove them wrong. And by the time her stoned and heavily inebriated older brother realised what she was doing, it was too late. The swim was well under way.\n\nAs she remembered this, the corridor at the end of the aisle in the library turned from stone to flowing water. And even as the shelves around her stayed where they were, the tiles beneath her feet now sprouted grass and the ceiling above her became sky. But unlike when she disappeared into another version of the present, Mrs Elm and the books remained. She was half in the library and half inside the memory.\n\nShe was staring at someone in the corridor-river. It was her younger self in the water, as the last of the summer light dissolved towards dark."}]}

It was one minute past midnight. She switched on her light. This was her exact life, but it was going to be better, because Voltaire was going to be alive in this one. Her real Voltaire.\n\nBut where was he?\n\n\u2018Volts?\u2019\n\nShe climbed out of bed.\n\n\u2018Volts?\u2019\n\nShe looked all over her flat and couldn\u2019t find him anywhere. The rain patted against the windows \u2013 that much hadn\u2019t changed. Her new box of anti-depressants was out on the kitchen unit. The electric piano stood by the wall, silent.\n\n\u2018Voltsy?\u2019\n\nThere was her yucca plant and her three tiny potted cacti, there were her bookshelves, with exactly the same mix of philosophy books and novels and untried yoga manuals and rock star biographies and pop science books. An old National Geographic with a shark on the cover and a five-month-old copy of Elle magazine, which she\u2019d bought mainly for the Ryan Bailey interview. No new additions in a long time.\n\nThere was a bowl still full of cat food.\n\nShe looked everywhere, calling his name. It was only when she went back into her bedroom and looked under the bed that she saw him.\n\n\u2018Volts!\u2019\n\nThe cat wasn\u2019t moving.\n\nAs her arms weren\u2019t long enough to reach him, she moved the bed.\n\n\u2018Voltsy. Come on, Voltsy,\u2019 she whispered.\n\nBut the moment she touched his cold body she knew, and she was flooded with sadness and confusion. She immediately found herself back in the Midnight Library, facing Mrs Elm, who was sat this time in a comfy chair, deeply absorbed in one of the books.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t understand,\u2019 Nora told her.\n\nMrs Elm kept her eyes on the page she was reading. \u2018There will be many things you don\u2019t understand.\u2019\n\n\u2018I asked for the life in which Voltaire was still alive.\u2019\n\n\u2018Actually, you didn\u2019t.\u2019\n\n\u2018What?\u2019\n\nShe put her book down. \u2018You asked for the life where you kept him indoors. That is an entirely different thing.\u2019\n\n\u2018Is it?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes. Entirely. You see, if you\u2019d have asked for the life where he was still alive I would have had to say no.\u2019\n\n\u2018But why?\u2019\n\n\u2018Because it doesn\u2019t exist.\u2019\n\n\u2018I thought every life exists.\u2019\n\n\u2018Every possible life. You see, it turns out that Voltaire had a serious case of\u2019 \u2013 she read carefully from the book \u2013 \u2018restrictive cardiomyopathy, a severe case of it, which he was born with, and which was destined to cause his heart to go at a young age.\u2019\n\n\u2018But he was hit by a car.\u2019\n\n\u2018There is a difference, Nora, between dying in a road and being hit by a car. In your root life Voltaire lived longer than almost any other life, except the one you\u2019ve just encountered, where he died only three hours ago. Although he had a tough few early years, the year you had him was the best of his life. Voltaire has had much worse lives, believe me.\u2019\n\n\u2018You didn\u2019t even know his name a moment ago. Now you know he had restrictive cardio-whatever?\u2019\n\n\u2018I knew his name. And it wasn\u2019t a moment ago. It was the same moment, check your watch.\u2019\n\n\u2018Why did you lie?\u2019\n\n\u2018I wasn\u2019t lying. I asked you what your cat\u2019s name was. I never said I didn\u2019t know what your cat\u2019s name was. Do you understand the difference? I just wanted you to say his name, so that you would feel something.\u2019\n\nNora was hot with agitation now. \u2018That\u2019s even worse! You sent me into that life knowing Volts would be dead. And Volts was dead. So, nothing changed.\u2019\n\nMrs Elm\u2019s eyes twinkled again. \u2018Except you.\u2019\n\n\u2018What do you mean?\u2019\n\n\u2018Well, you don\u2019t see yourself as a bad cat owner any more. You looked after him as well as he could have been looked after. He loved you as much as you loved him, and maybe he didn\u2019t want you to see him die. You see, cats know. They understand when their time is up. He went outside because he was going to die, and he knew it.\u2019\n\nNora tried to take this in. Now she thought about it, there hadn\u2019t been any external signs of damage on her cat\u2019s body. She had just jumped to the same conclusion that Ash had jumped to. That a dead cat on the road was probably dead because of the road. And if a surgeon could think that, a mere layperson would think that too. Two plus two equals car accident.\n\n\u2018Poor Volts,\u2019 Nora muttered, mournfully.\n\nMrs Elm smiled, like a teacher who saw a lesson being understood.\n\n\u2018He loved you, Nora. You looked after him as well as anyone could. Go and look at the last page of The Book of Regrets.\u2019\n\nNora could see that the book was lying on the floor. She knelt on the floor beside it.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t want to open it again.\u2019\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t worry. It will be safer this time. Just stick to the last page.\u2019\n\nOnce she had flicked to the last page, she saw one of her very last regrets \u2013 \u2018I was bad at looking after Voltaire\u2019 \u2013 slowly disappear from the page. The letters fading like retreating strangers in a fog.\n\nNora closed the book before she could feel anything bad happen.\n\n\u2018So, you see? Sometimes regrets aren\u2019t based on fact at all. Sometimes regrets are just . . .\u2019 She searched for the appropriate term and found it. \u2018A load of bullshit.\u2019\n\nNora tried to think back to her schooldays, to remember if Mrs Elm had said the word \u2018bullshit\u2019 before, and she was pretty sure she hadn\u2019t.\n\n\u2018But I still don\u2019t get why you let me go into that life if you knew Volts was going to be dead anyway? You could have told me. You could have just told me I wasn\u2019t a bad cat owner. Why didn\u2019t you?\u2019\n\n\u2018Because, Nora, sometimes the only way to learn is to live.\u2019\n\n\u2018Sounds hard.\u2019\n\n\u2018Take a seat,\u2019 Mrs Elm told her. \u2018A proper seat. It\u2019s not right, you kneeling on the floor.\u2019 And Nora turned to see a chair behind her that she hadn\u2019t noticed before. An antique chair \u2013 mahogany and buttoned leather, Edwardian maybe \u2013 with a brass bookstand attached to one arm. \u2018Give yourself a moment.\u2019\n\nNora sat down.\n\nShe stared at her watch. No matter how much of a moment she gave herself it stayed being midnight.\n\n\u2018I still don\u2019t like this. One life of sadness was enough. What is the point of risking more?\u2019\n\n\u2018Fine.\u2019 Mrs Elm shrugged.\n\n\u2018What?\u2019\n\n\u2018Let\u2019s do nothing then. You can just stay here in the library with all those lives waiting on the shelves and not choose one.\u2019\n\nNora sensed Mrs Elm was playing some kind of a game. But she went along with it.\n\n\u2018Fine.\u2019\n\nSo Nora just stood there while Mrs Elm picked up her book again.\n\nIt seemed unfair to Nora that Mrs Elm could read the lives without falling into them.\n\nTime went by.\n\nAlthough technically, of course, it didn\u2019t.\n\nNora could have stayed there for ever without getting hungry or thirsty or tired. But she could, it seemed, get bored.\n\nAs time stood still, Nora\u2019s curiosity about the lives around her slowly grew. It turned out to be near impossible to stand in a library and not want to pull things from the shelves.\n\n\u2018Why can\u2019t you just give me a life you know is a good one?\u2019 she said suddenly.\n\n\u2018That is not how this library works.\u2019\n\nNora had another question.\n\n\u2018Surely in most lives I will be asleep now, won\u2019t I?\u2019\n\n\u2018In many, yes.\u2019\n\n\u2018So, what happens then?\u2019\n\n\u2018You sleep. And then you wake up in that life. It\u2019s nothing to worry about. But if you are nervous, you could try a life where it\u2019s another time.\u2019\n\n\u2018What do you mean?\u2019\n\n\u2018Well, it\u2019s not night-time everywhere, is it?\u2019\n\n\u2018What?\u2019\n\n\u2018There are an infinite number of possible universes in which you live. Are you really saying they all exist on Greenwich Mean Time?\u2019\n\n\u2018Of course not,\u2019 said Nora. She realised she was about to cave in and choose another life. She thought of the humpback whales. She thought of the unanswered message. \u2018I wish I had gone to Australia with Izzy. I would like to experience that life.\u2019\n\n\u2018Very good choice.\u2019\n\n\u2018What? It\u2019s a very good life?\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh, I didn\u2019t say that. I merely feel that you might be getting better at choosing.\u2019\n\n\u2018So, it\u2019s a bad life?\u2019\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t say that either.\u2019\n\nAnd the shelves sped into motion again, then stopped a few seconds afterwards.\n\n\u2018Ah, yes, there it is,\u2019 said Mrs Elm, taking a book from the second-to-bottom shelf. She recognised it instantly, which was odd, seeing that it looked almost identical to the others around it.\n\nShe handed it to Nora, affectionately, as if it was a birthday gift.\n\n\u2018There you go. You know what to do.\u2019\n\nNora hesitated.\n\n\u2018What if I am dead?\u2019\n\n\u2018Sorry?\u2019\n\n\u2018I mean, in another life. There must be other lives in which I died before today.\u2019\n\nMrs Elm looked intrigued. \u2018Isn\u2019t that what you wanted?\u2019\n\n\u2018Well, yes, but\u2014\u2019\n\n\u2018You have died an infinite number of times before today, yes. Car accident, drug overdose, drowning, a bout of fatal food poisoning, choking on an apple, choking on a cookie, choking on a vegan hot dog, choking on a non-vegan hot dog, every illness it was possible for you to catch or contract . . . You have died in every way you can, at any time you could.\u2019\n\n\u2018So, I could open a book and just die?\u2019\n\n\u2018No. Not instantaneously. As with Voltaire, the only lives available here are, well, lives. I mean, you could die in that life, but you won\u2019t have died before you enter the life because this Midnight Library is not one of ghosts. It is not a library of corpses. It is a library of possibility. And death is the opposite of possibility. Understand?\u2019\n\n\u2018I think so.\u2019\n\nAnd Nora stared at the book she had been handed. Conifer green. Smooth-textured, again embossed with that broad and frustratingly meaningless title My Life.\n\nShe opened it and saw a blank page, so she moved to the next page and wondered what was going to happen this time. \u2018The swimming pool was a little busier than normal . . .\u2019\n\nAnd then she was there."}]}

Though she looked identical to the Mrs Elm Nora had always known, her manner was definitely a little more brusque. It was Mrs Elm but also somehow not Mrs Elm. It was quite confusing.\n\n\u2018Well what?\u2019 Nora said, still gasping, still relieved she could no longer feel the intensity of all her regrets simultaneously.\n\n\u2018Which regret stands out? Which decision would you like to undo? Which life would you like to try on?\u2019\n\nShe said that, precisely. Try on. As if this was a clothes shop and Nora could choose a life as easily as a T-shirt. It felt like a cruel game.\n\n\u2018That was agony. I felt like I was about to be strangled. What is the point of this?\u2019\n\nAs Nora looked up, she noticed the lights for the first time. Just naked bulbs hanging down from wires attached to the ceiling, which seemed like a normal kind of light-grey ceiling. Except it was a ceiling that reached no walls. Like the floor here, it went on for ever.\n\n\u2018The point is there is a strong possibility that your old life is over. You wanted to die and maybe you will. And you will need somewhere to go to. Somewhere to land. Another life. So, you need to think hard. This library is called the Midnight Library, because every new life on offer here begins now. And now is midnight. It begins now. All these futures. That\u2019s what is here. That\u2019s what your books represent. Every other immediate present and ongoing future you could have had.\u2019\n\n\u2018So there are no pasts in there?\u2019\n\n\u2018No. Just the consequence of them. But those books are also written. And I know them all. But they are not for you to read.\u2019\n\n\u2018And when does each life end?\u2019\n\n\u2018It could be seconds. Or hours. Or it could be days. Months. More. If you have found a life you truly want to live, then you get to live it until you die of old age. If you really want to live a life hard enough, you don\u2019t have to worry. You will stay there as if you have always been there. Because in one universe you have always been there. The book will never be returned, so to speak. It becomes less of a loan and more of a gift. The moment you decide you want that life, really want it, then everything that exists in your head now, including this Midnight Library, will eventually be a memory so vague and intangible it will hardly be there at all.\u2019\n\nOne of the lights flickered overhead.\n\n\u2018The only danger,\u2019 continued Mrs Elm, more ominously, \u2018is when you\u2019re here. Between lives. If you lose the will to carry on, it will affect your root life \u2013 your original life. And that could lead to the destruction of this place. You\u2019d be gone for ever. You\u2019d be dead. And so would your access to all this.\u2019\n\n\u2018That\u2019s what I want. I want to be dead. I would be dead because I want to be. That\u2019s why I took the overdose. I want to die.\u2019\n\n\u2018Well, maybe. Or maybe not. After all, you\u2019re still here.\u2019\n\nNora tried to get her head around this. \u2018So, how do I return to the library? If I\u2019m stuck in a life even worse than the one I\u2019ve just left?\u2019\n\n\u2018It can be subtle, but as soon as disappointment is felt in full, you\u2019ll come back here. Sometimes the feeling creeps up, other times it comes all at once. If it never arrives, you\u2019ll stay put, and you will be happy there, by definition. It couldn\u2019t be simpler. So: pick something you would have done differently, and I will find you the book. That is to say, the life.\u2019\n\nNora stared down at The Book of Regrets lying closed on the yellow-brown floor tiles.\n\nShe remembered chatting late at night with Dan about his dream of owning a quaint little pub in the country. His enthusiasm had been infectious, and it had almost become her dream too. \u2018I wish I hadn\u2019t left Dan. And that I was still in a relationship with him. I regret us not staying together and working towards that dream. Is there a life where we are still together?\u2019\n\n\u2018Of course,\u2019 said Mrs Elm.\n\nThe books in the library began to move again, as though the shelves were conveyor belts. This time, though, instead of going as slow as a wedding march they moved faster and faster and faster, until they couldn\u2019t really be seen as individual books at all. They just whirred by in streams of green.\n\nThen, just as suddenly, they stopped.\n\nMrs Elm crouched down and took a book from the lowest shelf to her left. The book was one of the darker shades of green. She handed it to Nora. It was a lot lighter than The Book of Regrets, even though it was a similar size. Again, there was no title on the spine but a small one embossed on the front, precisely the same shade as the rest of the book.\n\nIt said: My Life.\n\n\u2018But it\u2019s not my life . . .\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh Nora, they are all your lives.\u2019\n\n\u2018What do I do now?\u2019\n\n\u2018You open the book and turn to the first page.\u2019\n\nNora did so.\n\n\u2018O-kay,\u2019 said Mrs Elm, with careful precision. \u2018Now, read the first line.\u2019\n\nNora stared down and read.\n\nShe walked out of the pub into the cool night air . . .\n\nAnd Nora had just enough time to think to herself, \u2018Pub?\u2019 After that, it was happening. The text began to swirl and soon became indecipherable, in fast motion, as she felt herself weaken. She never knowingly let go of the book, but there was a moment where she was no longer a person reading it, and a consequent moment where there was no book \u2013 or library \u2013 at all."}]}

"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Tree That Is Our Life\n\nFive minutes later Nora was back in the hotel\u2019s vast conference room. At least a thousand people were watching the first speaker conclude her presentation. The author of Zero to Hero. The book Dan had beside his bed in another life. But Nora wasn\u2019t really listening, as she sat in her reserved seat in the front row. She was too upset about her mother, too nervous about the speech, so she just picked up the odd word or phrase that floated into her mind like croutons in minestrone. \u2018Little-known fact\u2019, \u2018ambition\u2019, \u2018what you may be surprised to hear is that\u2019, \u2018if I can do it\u2019, \u2018hard knocks\u2019.\n\nIt was hard to breathe in this room. It smelled of musky perfume and new carpet.\n\nShe tried to stay calm.\n\nLeaning into her brother, she whispered, \u2018I don\u2019t think I can do this.\u2019\n\n\u2018What?\u2019\n\n\u2018I think I\u2019m having a panic attack.\u2019\n\nHe looked at her, smiling, but with a toughness in his eyes she remembered from a different life, when she\u2019d had a panic attack before one of their early gigs with The Labyrinths at a pub in Bedford. \u2018You\u2019ll be fine.\u2019\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know if I can do this. I\u2019ve gone blank.\u2019\n\n\u2018You\u2019re overthinking it.\u2019\n\n\u2018I have anxiety. I have no other type of thinking available.\u2019\n\n\u2018Come on. Don\u2019t let us down.\u2019\n\nDon\u2019t let us down.\n\n\u2018But\u2014\u2019\n\nShe tried to think of music.\n\nThinking of music had always calmed her down.\n\nA tune came to her. She was slightly embarrassed, even within herself, to realise the song in her head was \u2018Beautiful Sky\u2019. A happy, hopeful song that she hadn\u2019t sung in a long time. The sky grows dark / The black over blue / Yet the stars still dare / To shine for\u2014\n\nBut then the person Nora was sitting next to \u2013 a smartly dressed business woman in her fifties, and the source of the musky perfume smell \u2013 leaned in and whispered, \u2018I\u2019m so sorry about what happened to you. You know, the stuff in Portugal .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u2019\n\n\u2018What stuff?\u2019\n\nThe woman\u2019s reply was drowned out as the audience erupted into applause at that moment.\n\n\u2018What?\u2019 she asked again.\n\nBut it was too late. Nora was being beckoned towards the stage and her brother was elbowing her.\n\nHer brother\u2019s voice, bellowing almost: \u2018They want you. Off you go.\u2019\n\nShe headed tentatively towards the lectern on the stage, towards her own huge face smiling out triumphantly, golden medal around her neck, projected on the screen behind her.\n\nShe had always hated being watched.\n\n\u2018Hello,\u2019 she said nervously, into the microphone. \u2018It is very nice to be here today .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u2019\n\nA thousand or so faces stared, waiting.\n\nShe had never spoken to so many people simultaneously. Even when she had been in The Labyrinths, they had never played a gig for more than a hundred people, and back then she kept the talking between the songs as minimal as possible. Working at String Theory, although she was perfectly okay talking with customers, she rarely spoke up in staff meetings, even though there had never been more than five people in the room. Back at university, while Izzy always breezed through presentations Nora would worry about them for weeks in advance.\n\nJoe and Rory were staring at her with baffled expressions.\n\nThe Nora she had seen in the TED talk was not this Nora, and she doubted she could ever become that person. Not without having done all that she had done.\n\n\u2018Hello. My name is Nora Seed.\u2019\n\nShe hadn\u2019t meant it to be funny but the whole room laughed at this. There had clearly been no need to introduce herself.\n\n\u2018Life is strange,\u2019 she said. \u2018How we live it all at once. In a straight line. But really that\u2019s not the whole picture. Because life isn\u2019t simply made of the things we do, but the things we don\u2019t do too. And every moment of our life is a .\u00a0.\u00a0. kind of turning.\u2019\n\nStill nothing.\n\n\u2018Think about it. Think about how we start off .\u00a0.\u00a0. as this set thing. Like the seed of a tree planted in the ground. And then we .\u00a0.\u00a0. we grow .\u00a0.\u00a0. we grow .\u00a0.\u00a0. and at first we are a trunk .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u2019\n\nAbsolutely nothing.\n\n\u2018But then the tree \u2013 the tree that is our life \u2013 develops branches. And think of all those branches, departing from the trunk at different heights. And think of all those branches, branching off again, heading in often opposing directions. Think of those branches becoming other branches, and those becoming twigs. And think of the end of each of those twigs, all in different places, having started from the same one. A life is like that, but on a bigger scale. New branches are formed every second of every day. And from our perspective \u2013 from everyone\u2019s perspective \u2013 it feels like a .\u00a0.\u00a0. like a continuum. Each twig has travelled only one journey. But there are still other twigs. And there are also other todays. Other lives that would have been different if you\u2019d taken different directions earlier in your life. This is a tree of life. Lots of religions and mythologies have talked about the tree of life. It\u2019s there in Buddhism, Judaism and Christianity. Lots of philosophers and writers have talked about tree metaphors too. For Sylvia Plath, existence was a fig tree and each possible life she could live \u2013 the happily-married one, the successful-poet one \u2013 was this sweet juicy fig, but she couldn\u2019t get to taste the sweet juicy figs and so they just rotted right in front of her. It can drive you insane, thinking of all the other lives we don\u2019t live.\n\n\u2018For instance, in most of my lives I am not standing at this podium talking to you about success .\u00a0.\u00a0. In most lives I am not an Olympic gold medallist.\u2019 She remembered something Mrs Elm had told her in the Midnight Library. \u2018You see, doing one thing differently is very often the same as doing everything differently. Actions can\u2019t be reversed within a lifetime, however much we try .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u2019\n\nPeople were listening now. They clearly needed a Mrs Elm in their lives.\n\n\u2018The only way to learn is to live.\u2019\n\nAnd she went on in this manner for another twenty minutes, remembering as much as possible of what Mrs Elm had told her, and then she looked down at her hands, glowing white from the light of the lectern.\n\nAs she absorbed the sight of a raised, thin pink line of flesh, she knew the scar was self-inflicted, and it put her off her flow. Or rather, put her into a new one.\n\n\u2018And .\u00a0.\u00a0. and the thing is .\u00a0.\u00a0. the thing is .\u00a0.\u00a0. what we consider to be the most successful route for us to take, actually isn\u2019t. Because too often our view of success is about some external bullshit idea of achievement \u2013 an Olympic medal, the ideal husband, a good salary. And we have all these metrics that we try and reach. When really success isn\u2019t something you measure, and life isn\u2019t a race you can win. It\u2019s all .\u00a0.\u00a0. bollocks, actually .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u2019\n\nThe audience definitely looked uncomfortable now. Clearly this was not the speech they were expecting. She scanned the crowd and saw a single face smiling up at her. It took a second, given the fact that he was smartly dressed in a blue cotton shirt and with hair far shorter than it was in his Bedford life, for her to realise it was Ravi. This Ravi looked friendly, but she couldn\u2019t shake the knowledge of the other Ravi, the one who had stormed out of the newsagent\u2019s, sulking about not being able to afford a magazine and blaming her for it.\n\n\u2018You see, I know that you were expecting my TED talk on the path to success. But the truth is that success is a delusion. It\u2019s all a delusion. I mean, yes, there are things we can overcome. For instance, I am someone who gets stage fright and yet, here I am, on a stage. Look at me .\u00a0.\u00a0. on a stage! And someone told me recently, they told me that my problem isn\u2019t actually stage fright. My problem is life fright. And you know what? They\u2019re fucking right. Because life is frightening, and it is frightening for a reason, and the reason is that it doesn\u2019t matter which branch of a life we get to live, we are always the same rotten tree. I wanted to be many things in my life. All kinds of things. But if your life is rotten, it will be rotten no matter what you do. The damp rots the whole useless thing .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u2019\n\nJoe was desperately slicing his hand in the air around his neck, making a \u2018cut it\u2019 gesture.\n\n\u2018Anyway, just be kind and .\u00a0.\u00a0. Just be kind. I have a feeling I am about to go, so I would just like to say I love my brother Joe. I love you, brother, and I love everyone in this room, and it was very nice to be here.\u2019\n\nAnd the moment she had said it was nice to be there, was also the moment she wasn\u2019t there at all."}]}

This was the loosely defined office area she had glimpsed earlier, in one of the broader corridors. The desk was covered with administrative trays barely containing scattered piles of papers and boxes, and the computer.\n\nThe computer was a really old-fashioned-looking, cream-coloured boxy one on the desk by the papers. The kind that Mrs Elm would once have had in her school library. She was at the keyboard now, typing with urgency, staring at the monitor as Nora stood behind her.\n\nThe lights above \u2013 the same bare light bulbs hanging down from wires \u2013 were flickering wildly.\n\n\u2018My dad was alive because of me. But he\u2019d also had an affair, and my mum died earlier, and I got on with my brother because I had never let him down, but he was still the same brother, really, and he was only really okay with me in that life because I was helping him make money and .\u00a0.\u00a0. and .\u00a0.\u00a0. it wasn\u2019t the Olympic dream I imagined.

Are there any other lives at all or is it just the furnishings that change?\u2019\n\nBut Mrs Elm wasn\u2019t listening. Nora noticed something on the desk. An old plastic orange fountain pen. The exact same kind that Nora had once owned at school.\n\n\u2018Hello? Mrs Elm, can you hear me?\u2019\n\nSomething was wrong.\n\nThe librarian\u2019s face was tight with worry. She read from the screen, to herself. \u2018System error.\u2019\n\n\u2018Mrs Elm? Hello? Yoo-hoo! Can you see me?\u2019\n\nShe tapped her shoulder. That seemed to do it.\n\nMrs Elm\u2019s face broke out in massive relief as she turned away from the computer. \u2018Oh Nora, you got here?\u2019\n\n\u2018Were you expecting me not to? Did you think that life would be the one I wanted to live?\u2019\n\nShe shook her head without really moving it. If that was possible. \u2018No. It\u2019s not that. It\u2019s just that it looked fragile.\u2019\n\n\u2018What looked fragile?\u2019\n\n\u2018The transfer.\u2019\n\n\u2018Transfer?\u2019\n\n\u2018From the book to here. The life you chose to here. It seems there is a problem. A problem with the whole system. Something beyond my immediate control. Something external.\u2019\n\n\u2018You mean, in my actual life?\u2019\n\nShe stared back at the screen. \u2018Yes. You see, the Midnight Library only exists because you do. In your root life.\u2019\n\n\u2018So, I\u2019m dying?\u2019\n\nMrs Elm looked exasperated. \u2018It\u2019s a possibility. That is to say, it\u2019s a possibility that we are reaching the end of possibility.\u2019\n\nNora thought of how good it had felt, swimming in the pool. How vital and alive. And then something happened inside her. A strange feeling. A pull in her stomach. A physical shift. A change in her. The idea of death suddenly troubled her. At that same time the lights stopped flickering overhead and shone brightly.\n\nMrs Elm clapped her hands as she absorbed new information on the computer screen.\n\n\u2018Oh, it\u2019s back. That\u2019s good. The glitch is gone. We are running again. Thanks, I believe, to you.\u2019\n\n\u2018What?\u2019\n\n\u2018Well, the computer says the root cause within the host has been temporarily fixed. And you are the root cause. You are the host.\u2019 She smiled. Nora blinked, and when she opened her eyes both she and Mrs Elm were standing in a different part of the library. Between stacks of bookshelves again. Standing, stiffly, awkwardly, facing each other.\n\n\u2018Right. Now, settle,\u2019 said Mrs Elm, before releasing a deep and meaningful exhale. She was clearly talking to herself.\n\n\u2018My mum died on different dates in different lives. I\u2019d like a life where she is still here. Does that life exist?\u2019\n\nMrs Elm\u2019s attention switched to Nora.\n\n\u2018Maybe it does.\u2019\n\n\u2018Great.\u2019\n\n\u2018But you can\u2019t get there.\u2019\n\n\u2018Why not?\u2019\n\n\u2018Because this library is about your decisions. There was no choice you could have made that led to her being alive beyond yesterday. I\u2019m sorry.\u2019\n\nA light bulb flickered above Nora\u2019s head. But the rest of the library stayed as it was.\n\n\u2018You need to think about something else, Nora. What was good about the last life?\u2019\n\nNora nodded. \u2018Swimming. I liked swimming. But I don\u2019t think I was happy in that life. I don\u2019t know if I am truly happy in any life.\u2019\n\n\u2018Is happiness the aim?\u2019\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know. I suppose I want my life to mean something. I want to do something good.\u2019\n\n\u2018You once wanted to be a glaciologist,\u2019 Mrs Elm appeared to remember.\n\n\u2018Yeah.\u2019\n\n\u2018You used to talk about it. You said you were interested in the Arctic, so I suggested you become a glaciologist.\u2019\n\n\u2018I remember. I liked the sound of it straight away. My mum and dad never liked the idea, though.\u2019\n\n\u2018Why?\u2019\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t really know. They encouraged swimming. Well, Dad did. But anything that involved academic work, they were funny about.\u2019\n\nNora felt a deep sadness, down in her stomach. From her arrival into life, she was considered by her parents in a different way to her brother.\n\n\u2018Other than swimming, Joe was the one expected to pursue things,\u2019 she told Mrs Elm. \u2018My mum put me off anything that could take me away. Unlike Dad, she didn\u2019t even push me to swim. But surely there must be a life where I didn\u2019t listen to my mum and where I am now an Arctic researcher. Far away from everything. With a purpose. Helping the planet. Researching the impact of climate change. On the front line.\u2019\n\n\u2018So, you want me to find that life for you?\u2019\n\nNora sighed. She still had no idea what she wanted. But at least the Arctic Circle would be different.\n\n\u2018All right. Yes.\u2019"}]}
