To be always in the sunshine, you need only walk along rather slowly.

Something was broken in my engine. And as I had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone. It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week.\n\nThe first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation. I was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean. Thus you can imagine my amazement, at sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice. It said:\n\n'If you please--draw me a sheep!'\n\n'What!'\n\n'Draw me a sheep!'\n\nI jumped to my feet, completely thunderstruck. I blinked my eyes hard. I looked carefully all around me. And I saw a most extraordinary small person, who stood there examining me with great seriousness. Here you may see the best portrait that, later, I was able to make of him. But my drawing is certainly very much less charming than its model.\n\n\nThat, however, is not my fault. The grown-ups discouraged me in my painter's career when I was six years old, and I never learned to draw anything, except boas from the outside and boas from the inside.\n\nNow I stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly starting out of my head in astonishment. Remember, I had crashed in the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region. And yet my little man seemed neither to be straying uncertainly among the sands, nor to be fainting from fatigue or hunger or thirst or fear. Nothing about him gave any suggestion of a child lost in the middle of the desert, a thousand miles from any human habitation. When at last I was able to speak, I said to him:\n\n'But--what are you doing here?'\n\nAnd in answer he repeated, very slowly, as if he were speaking of a matter of great consequence:\n\n'If you please--draw me a sheep . . .'\n\nWhen a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not disobey. Absurd as it might seem to me, a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death, I took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and my fountain-pen. But then I remembered how my studies had been concentrated on geography, history, arithmetic and grammar, and I told the little chap (a little crossly, too) that I did not know how to draw. He answered me:\n\n'That doesn't matter. Draw me a sheep . . .'\n\nBut I had never drawn a sheep. So I drew for him one of the two pictures I had drawn so often. It was that of the boa constrictor from the outside. And I was astounded to hear the little fellow greet it with,\n\n'No, no, no! I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor. A boa constrictor is a very dangerous creature, and an elephant is very cumbersome. Where I live, everything is very small. What I need is a sheep. Draw me a sheep.'\n\nSo then I made a drawing.\n\n\nHe looked at it carefully, then he said:\n\n'No. This sheep is already very sickly. Make me another.'\n\nSo I made another drawing.\n\n\nMy friend smiled gently and indulgently.\n\n'You see yourself,' he said, 'that this is not a sheep. This is a ram. It has horns.'\n\nSo then I did my drawing over once more.\n\n\nBut it was rejected too, just like the others.\n\n'This one is too old. I want a sheep that will live a long time.'\n\nBy this time my patience was exhausted, because I was in a hurry to start taking my engine apart. So I tossed off this drawing.\n\n\nAnd I threw out an explanation with it.\n\n'This is only his box. The sheep you asked for is inside.'\n\nI was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young judge:\n\n'That is exactly the way I wanted it! Do you think that this sheep will have to have a great deal of grass?'\n\n'Why?'\n\n'Because where I live everything is very small . . .'\n\n'There will surely be enough grass for him,' I said. 'It is a very small sheep that I have given you.'\n\nHe bent his head over the drawing.\n\n'Not so small that--Look! He has gone to sleep . . .'\n\nAnd that is how I made the acquaintance of the little prince.\n\n"}]}

As for me, I was upset over that bolt. And I answered with the first thing that came into my head:\n\n'The thorns are of no use at all. Flowers have thorns just for spite!'\n\n'Oh!'\n\nThere was a moment of complete silence. Then the little prince flashed back at me, with a kind of resentfulness:\n\n'I don't believe you!

At that instant I was saying to myself: 'If this bolt still won't turn, I am going to knock it out with the hammer.' Again the little prince disturbed my thoughts:\n\n'And you actually believe that the flowers--'\n\n'Oh, no!' I cried. 'No, no, no! I don't believe anything.

He has never done anything in his life but add up figures. And all day he says over and over, just like you: 'I am busy with matters of consequence!' And that makes him swell up with pride. But he is not a man--he is a mushroom!'\n\n'A what?'\n\n'A mushroom!'\n\nThe little prince was now white with rage.\n\n'The flowers have been growing thorns for millions of years. For millions of years the sheep have been eating them just the same. And is it not a matter of consequence to try to understand why the flowers go to so much trouble to grow thorns which are never of any use to them? Is the warfare between the sheep and the flowers not important? Is this not of more consequence than a fat red-faced gentleman's sums?

You think that is not important!'\n\n\n\nHis face turned from white to red as he continued:\n\n'If some one loves a flower, of which just one single blossom grows in all the millions and millions of stars, it is enough to make him happy just to look at the stars. He can say to himself, 'Somewhere, my flower is there . . .' But if the sheep eats the flower, in one moment all his stars will be darkened . . .

Of what moment now was my hammer, my bolt, or thirst, or death? On one star, one planet, my planet, the Earth, there was a little prince to be comforted. I took him in my arms, and rocked him. I said to him:\n\n'The flower that you love is not in danger. I will draw you a muzzle for your sheep. I will draw you a railing to put around your flower. I will--'\n\nI did not know what to say to him. I felt awkward and blundering.

I knew very well that in addition to the great planets--such as the Earth, Jupiter, Mars, Venus--to which we have given names, there are also hundreds of others, some of which are so small that one has a hard time seeing them through the telescope. When an astronomer discovers one of these he does not give it a name, but only a number. He might call it, for example, 'Asteroid 325.'\n\n\n\nI have serious reason to believe that the planet from which the little prince came is the asteroid known as B-612.\n\nThis asteroid has only once been seen through the telescope. That was by a Turkish astronomer, in 1909.\n\n\nOn making his discovery, the astronomer had presented it to the International Astronomical Congress, in a great demonstration. But he was in Turkish costume, and so nobody would believe what he said.\n\nGrown-ups are like that . . .\n\nFortunately, however, for the reputation of Asteroid B-612, a Turkish dictator made a law that his subjects, under pain of death, should change to European costume. So in 1920 the astronomer gave his demonstration all over again, dressed with impressive style and elegance. And this time everybody accepted his report.\n\n\nIf I have told you these details about the asteroid, and made a note of its number for you, it is on account of the grown-ups and their ways. When you tell them that you have made a new friend, they never ask you any questions about essential matters. They never say to you, 'What does his voice sound like? What games does he love best? Does he collect butterflies?' Instead, they demand: 'How old is he? How many brothers has he? How much does he weigh? How much money does his father make?' Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him.\n\nIf you were to say to the grown-ups: 'I saw a beautiful house made of rosy brick, with geraniums in the windows and doves on the roof,' they would not be able to get any idea of that house at all. You would have to say to them: 'I saw a house that cost $20,000.' Then they would exclaim: 'Oh, what a pretty house that is!'\n\nJust so, you might say to them: 'The proof that the little prince existed is that he was charming, that he laughed, and that he was looking for a sheep. If anybody wants a sheep, that is a proof that he exists.' And what good would it do to tell them that? They would shrug their shoulders, and treat you like a child. But if you said to them: 'The planet he came from is Asteroid B-612,' then they would be convinced, and leave you in peace from their questions.\n\nThey are like that. One must not hold it against them. Children should always show great forbearance toward grown-up people.\n\nBut certainly, for us who understand life, figures are a matter of indifference. I should have liked to begin this story in the fashion of the fairy-tales. I should have like to say: 'Once upon a time there was a little prince who lived on a planet that was scarcely any bigger than himself, and who had need of a sheep . . .'\n\nTo those who understand life, that would have given a much greater air of truth to my story.\n\nFor I do not want any one to read my book carelessly. I have suffered too much grief in setting down these memories. Six years have already passed since my friend went away from me, with his sheep. If I try to describe him here, it is to make sure that I shall not forget him. To forget a friend is sad. Not every one has had a friend. And if I forget him, I may become like the grown-ups who are no longer interested in anything but figures . . .\n\nIt is for that purpose, again, that I have bought a box of paints and some pencils. It is hard to take up drawing again at my age, when I have never made any pictures except those of the boa constrictor from the outside and the boa constrictor from the inside, since I was six. I shall certainly try to make my portraits as true to life as possible. But I am not at all sure of success. One drawing goes along all right, and another has no resemblance to its subject. I make some errors, too, in the little prince's height: in one place he is too tall and in another too short. And I feel some doubts about the color of his costume. So I fumble along as best I can, now good, now bad, and I hope generally fair-to-middling.\n\nIn certain more important details I shall make mistakes, also. But that is something that will not be my fault. My friend never explained anything to me. He thought, perhaps, that I was like himself. But I, alas, do not know how to see sheep through the walls of boxes. Perhaps I am a little like the grown-ups. I have had to grow old."}]}

The information would come very slowly, as it might chance to fall from his thoughts. It was in this way that I heard, on the third day, about the catastrophe of the baobabs.\n\nThis time, once more, I had the sheep to thank for it. For the little prince asked me abruptly--as if seized by a grave doubt--'It is true, isn't it, that sheep eat little bushes?'\n\n'Yes, that is true.'\n\n'Ah! I am glad!'\n\nI did not understand why it was so important that sheep should eat little bushes. But the little prince added:\n\n'Then it follows that they also eat baobabs?'\n\nI pointed out to the little prince that baobabs were not little bushes, but, on the contrary, trees as big as castles; and that even if he took a whole herd of elephants away with him, the herd would not eat up one single baobab.\n\nThe idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince laugh.\n\n'We would have to put them one on top of the other,' he said.\n\n\nBut he made a wise comment:\n\n'Before they grow so big, the baobabs start out by being little.'\n\n'That is strictly correct,' I said. 'But why do you want the sheep to eat the little baobabs?'\n\nHe answered me at once, 'Oh, come, come!', as if he were speaking of something that was self-evident. And I was obliged to make a great mental effort to solve this problem, without any assistance.\n\nIndeed, as I learned, there were on the planet where the little prince lived--as on all planets--good plants and bad plants. In consequence, there were good seeds from good plants, and bad seeds from bad plants. But seeds are invisible. They sleep deep in the heart of the earth's darkness, until some one among them is seized with the desire to awaken. Then this little seed will stretch itself and begin--timidly at first--to push a charming little sprig inoffensively upward toward the sun. If it is only a sprout of radish or the sprig of a rose-bush, one would let it grow wherever it might wish. But when it is a bad plant, one must destroy it as soon as possible, the very first instant that one recognizes it.\n\n\nNow there were some terrible seeds on the planet that was the home of the little prince; and these were the seeds of the baobab. The soil of that planet was infested with them. A baobab is something you will never, never be able to get rid of if you attend to it too late. It spreads over the entire planet. It bores clear through it with its roots. And if the planet is too small, and the baobabs are too many, they split it in pieces . . .\n\n'It is a question of discipline,' the little prince said to me later on. 'When you've finished your own toilet in the morning, then it is time to attend to the toilet of your planet, just so, with the greatest care. You must see to it that you pull up regularly all the baobabs, at the very first moment when they can be distinguished from the rosebushes which they resemble so closely in their earliest youth. It is very tedious work,' the little prince added, 'but very easy.'\n\nAnd one day he said to me: 'You ought to make a beautiful drawing, so that the children where you live can see exactly how all this is. That would be very useful to them if they were to travel some day. Sometimes,' he added, 'there is no harm in putting off a piece of work until another day. But when it is a matter of baobabs, that always means a catastrophe. I knew a planet that was inhabited by a lazy man. He neglected three little bushes . . .'\n\nSo, as the little prince described it to me, I have made a drawing of that planet. I do not much like to take the tone of a moralist. But the danger of the baobabs is so little understood, and such considerable risks would be run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid, that for once I am breaking through my reserve. 'Children,' I say plainly, 'watch out for the baobabs!'\n\nMy friends, like myself, have been skirting this danger for a long time, without ever knowing it; and so it is for them that I have worked so hard over this drawing. The lesson which I pass on by this means is worth all the trouble it has cost me.\n\n\nPerhaps you will ask me, 'Why are there no other drawing in this book as magnificent and impressive as this drawing of the baobabs?'\n\nThe reply is simple. I have tried. But with the others I have not been successful. When I made the drawing of the baobabs I was carried beyond myself by the inspiring force of urgent necessity."}]}

It’s good to see you.’\n\nA few weeks ago she’d been sat playing her electric piano and he’d run down Bancroft Avenue and had seen her in the window here at 33A and given her a little wave. He had once – years ago – asked her out for a coffee. Maybe he was about to do that again.\n\n‘It’s good to see you too,’ he said, but his tense forehead didn’t show it.\n\nWhen she’d spoken to him in the shop, he’d always sounded breezy, but now his voice contained something heavy. He scratched his brow. Made another sound but didn’t quite manage a full word.\n\n‘You running?’ A pointless question. He was clearly out for a run. But he seemed relieved, momentarily, to have something trivial to say.\n\n‘Yeah. I’m doing the Bedford Half. It’s this Sunday.’\n\n‘Oh right. Great. I was thinking of doing a half-marathon and then I remembered I hate running.’\n\nThis had sounded funnier in her head than it did as actual words being vocalised out of her mouth. She didn’t even hate running. But still, she was perturbed to see the seriousness of his expression. The silence went beyond awkward into something else.\n\n‘You told me you had a cat,’ he said eventually.\n\n‘Yes. I have a cat.’\n\n‘I remembered his name. Voltaire. A ginger tabby?’\n\n‘Yeah. I call him Volts. He finds Voltaire a bit pretentious. It turns out he’s not massively into eighteenth-century French philosophy and literature. He’s quite down-to-earth. You know. For a cat.’\n\nAsh looked down at her slippers.\n\n‘I’m afraid I think he’s dead.’\n\n‘What?’\n\n‘He’s lying very still by the side of the road. I saw the name on the collar, I think a car might have hit him. I’m sorry, Nora.’\n\nShe was so scared of her sudden switch in emotions right then that she kept smiling, as if the smile could keep her in the world she had just been in, the one where Volts was alive and where this man she’d sold guitar songbooks to had rung her doorbell for another reason.\n\nAsh, she remembered, was a surgeon. Not a veterinary one, a general human one. If he said something was dead it was, in all probability, dead.\n\n‘I’m so sorry.’\n\nNora had a familiar sense of grief. Only the sertraline stopped her crying. ‘Oh God.’\n\nShe stepped out onto the wet cracked paving slabs of Bancroft Avenue, hardly breathing, and saw the poor ginger-furred creature lying on the rain-glossed tarmac beside the kerb. His head grazed the side of the pavement and his legs were back as if in mid-gallop, chasing some imaginary bird.\n\n‘Oh Volts. Oh no. Oh God.’\n\nShe knew she should be experiencing pity and despair for her feline friend – and she was – but she had to acknowledge something else. As she stared at Voltaire’s still and peaceful expression – that total absence of pain – there was an inescapable feeling brewing in the darkness.\n\nEnvy."}]}

What is most important is invisible . . .'\n\nAs his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: 'What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep . . .'

One can count, there, 111 kings (not forgetting, to be sure, the Negro kings among them), 7000 geographers, 900,000 businessmen, 7,500,000 tipplers, 311,000,000 conceited men--that is to say, about 2,000,000,000 grown-ups.\n\nTo give you an idea of the size of the Earth, I will tell you that before the invention of electricity it was necessary to maintain, over the whole of the six continents, a veritable army of 462,511 lamplighters for the street lamps.\n\nSeen from a slight distance, that would make a splendid spectacle. The movements of this army would be regulated like those of the ballet in the opera. First would come the turn of the lamplighters of New Zealand and Australia. Having set their lamps alight, these would go off to sleep. Next, the lamplighters of China and Siberia would enter for their steps in the dance, and then they too would be waved back into the wings. After that would come the turn of the lamplighters of Russia and the Indies; then those of Africa and Europe; then those of South America; then those of South America; then those of North America. And never would they make a mistake in the order of their entry upon the stage. It would be magnificent.\n\nOnly the man who was in charge of the single lamp at the North Pole, and his colleague who was responsible for the single lamp at the South Pole--only these two would live free from toil and care: they would be busy twice a year."}]}

As she navigates through these different lives, Nora grapples with existential questions and learns valuable lessons about the importance of choices, regrets, and the pursuit of happiness. The novel explores themes of self-discovery, acceptance, and the impact of our decisions on the course of our lives. Ultimately, 'The Midnight Library' encourages readers to reflect on their own lives and the paths they choose to take."}, {"role" : "user", "content" : "Write a chapter based on the description: Nora examines The Book of Regrets, which is divided into chapters from 0 to 35, one for each year of her life.

The small typeface embossed on the cover.\n\nThe Book of Regrets\n\n‘Every regret you have ever had, since the day you were born, is recorded in here,’ Mrs Elm said, tapping her finger on the cover. ‘I now give you permission to open it.’\n\nAs the book was so heavy Nora sat down cross-legged on the stone floor to do so. She began to skim through it.\n\nThe book was divided into chapters, chronologically arranged around the years of her life. 0, 1, 2, 3, all the way up to 35. The chapters got much longer as the book progressed, year by year. But the regrets she accumulated weren’t specifically related to that year in question.\n\n‘Regrets ignore chronology. They float around. The sequence of these lists changes all the time.’\n\n‘Right, yes, that makes sense, I suppose.’\n\nShe quickly realised they ranged from the minor and quotidian (‘I regret not doing any exercise today’) to the substantial (‘I regret not telling my father I loved him before he died’).\n\nThere were continual, background regrets, which repeated on multiple pages. ‘I regret not staying in The Labyrinths, because I let down my brother.’ ‘I regret not staying in The Labyrinths, because I let down myself.’ ‘I regret not doing more for the environment.’ ‘I regret the time I spent on social media.’ ‘I regret not going to Australia with Izzy.’ ‘I regret not having more fun when I was younger.’ ‘I regret all those arguments with Dad.’ ‘I regret not working with animals.’ ‘I regret not doing Geology at University instead of Philosophy.’ ‘I regret not learning how to be a happier person.’ ‘I regret feeling so much guilt.’ ‘I regret not sticking at Spanish.’ ‘I regret not choosing science subjects in my A-levels.’ ‘I regret not becoming a glaciologist.’ ‘I regret not getting married.’ ‘I regret not applying to do a Master’s degree in Philosophy at Cambridge.’ ‘I regret not keeping healthy.’ ‘I regret moving to London.’ ‘I regret not going to Paris to teach English.’ ‘I regret not finishing the novel I started at university.’ ‘I regret moving out of London.’ ‘I regret having a job with no prospects.’ ‘I regret not being a better sister.’ ‘I regret not having a gap year after university.’ ‘I regret disappointing my father.’ ‘I regret that I teach piano more than I play it.’ ‘I regret my financial mismanagement.’ ‘I regret not living in the countryside.’\n\nSome regrets were a little fainter than others. One regret shifted from practically invisible to bold and back again, as if it was flashing on and off, right there as she looked at it. The regret was ‘I regret not yet having children.’\n\n‘That is a regret that sometimes is and sometimes isn’t,’ explained Mrs Elm, again somehow reading her mind. ‘There are a few of those.’\n\nFrom the age of 34 onwards, in the longest chapter at the end of the book, there were a lot of Dan-specific regrets. These were quite strong and bold, and played in her head like an ongoing fortissimo chord in a Haydn concerto.\n\n‘I regret being cruel to Dan.’ ‘I regret breaking up with Dan.’ ‘I regret not living in a country pub with Dan.’\n\nAs she stared down at the pages, she thought now of the man she had so nearly married."}]}
