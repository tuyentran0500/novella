He had already traveled so much and so far!\n\n'Where do you come from?' the old gentleman said to him.\n\n'What is that big book?' said the little prince. 'What are you doing?'\n\n'I am a geographer,' said the old gentleman.\n\n'What is a geographer?' asked the little prince.\n\n'A geographer is a scholar who knows the location of all the seas, rivers, towns, mountains, and deserts.'\n\n'That is very interesting,' said the little prince. 'Here at last is a man who has a real profession!' And he cast a look around him at the planet of the geographer. It was the most magnificent and stately planet that he had ever seen.\n\n'Your planet is very beautiful,' he said. 'Has it any oceans?'\n\n'I couldn't tell you,' said the geographer.\n\n'Ah!' The little prince was disappointed. 'Has it any mountains?'\n\n'I couldn't tell you,' said the geographer.\n\n'And towns, and rivers, and deserts?'\n\n'I couldn't tell you that, either.'\n\n'But you are a geographer!'\n\n'Exactly,' the geographer said. 'But I am not an explorer. I haven't a single explorer on my planet. It is not the geographer who goes out to count the towns, the rivers, the mountains, the seas, the oceans, and the deserts. The geographer is much too important to go loafing about. He does not leave his desk. But he receives the explorers in his study. He asks them questions, and he notes down what they recall of their travels. And if the recollections of any one among them seem interesting to him, the geographer orders an inquiry into that explorer's moral character.'\n\n'Why is that?'\n\n'Because an explorer who told lies would bring disaster on the books of the geographer. So would an explorer who drank too much.'\n\n'Why is that?' asked the little prince.\n\n'Because intoxicated men see double. Then the geographer would note down two mountains in a place where there was only one.'\n\n'I know some one,' said the little prince, 'who would make a bad explorer.'\n\n'That is possible. Then, when the moral character of the explorer is shown to be good, an inquiry is ordered into his discovery.'\n\n'One goes to see it?'\n\n'No. That would be too complicated. But one requires the explorer to furnish proofs. For example, if the discovery in question is that of a large mountain, one requires that large stones be brought back from it.'\n\nThe geographer was suddenly stirred to excitement.\n\n'But you--you come from far away! You are an explorer! You shall describe your planet to me!'\n\nAnd, having opened his big register, the geographer sharpened his pencil. The recitals of explorers are put down first in pencil. One waits until the explorer has furnished proofs, before putting them down in ink.\n\n'Well?' said the geographer expectantly.\n\n'Oh, where I live,' said the little prince, 'it is not very interesting. It is all so small. I have three volcanoes. Two volcanoes are active and the other is extinct. But one never knows.'\n\n'One never knows,' said the geographer.\n\n'I have also a flower.'\n\n'We do not record flowers,' said the geographer.\n\n'Why is that? The flower is the most beautiful thing on my planet!'\n\n'We do not record them,' said the geographer, 'because they are ephemeral.'\n\n'What does that mean--'ephemeral'?'\n\n'Geographies,' said the geographer, 'are the books which, of all books, are most concerned with matters of consequence. They never become old-fashioned. It is very rarely that a mountain changes its position. It is very rarely that an ocean empties itself of its waters. We write of eternal things.'\n\n'But extinct volcanoes may come to life again,' the little prince interrupted. 'What does that mean-- 'ephemeral'?'\n\n'Whether volcanoes are extinct or alive, it comes to the same thing for us,' said the geographer. 'The thing that matters to us is the mountain. It does not change.'\n\n'But what does that mean--'ephemeral'?' repeated the little prince, who never in his life had let go of a question, once he had asked it.\n\n'It means, 'which is in danger of speedy disappearance.''\n\n'Is my flower in danger of speedy disappearance?'\n\n'Certainly it is.'\n\n'My flower is ephemeral,' the little prince said to himself, 'and she has only four thorns to defend herself against the world. And I have left her on my planet, all alone!'\n\nThat was his first moment of regret. But he took courage once more.\n\n'What place would you advise me to visit now?' he asked.\n\n'The planet Earth,' replied the geographer.

She was standing on a path, some kind of colonnade. The columns were brain-grey, with specks of brilliant blue. The misty vapours cleared, like spirits wanting to be unwatched, and a shape emerged.\n\nA solid, rectangular shape.\n\nThe shape of a building. About the size of a church or a small supermarket. It had a stone facade, the same colouration as the pillars, with a large wooden central door and a roof which had aspirations of grandeur, with intricate details and a grand-looking clock on the front gable, with black-painted Roman numerals and its hands pointing to midnight. Tall dark arched windows, framed with stone bricks, punctuated the front wall, equidistant from each other. When she first looked it seemed there were only four windows, but a moment later there were definitely five of them. She thought she must have miscounted.\n\nAs there was nothing else around, and since she had nowhere else to be, Nora stepped cautiously towards it.\n\nShe looked at the digital display of her watch.\n\n00:00:00\n\nMidnight, as the clock had told her.\n\nShe waited for the next second to arrive, but it didn’t. Even as she walked closer to the building, even as she opened the wooden door, even as she stepped inside, the display didn’t change. Either something was wrong with her watch, or something was wrong with time. In the circumstances, it could have been either.\n\nWhat’s happening? she wondered. What the hell is going on?\n\nMaybe this place would hold some answers, she thought, as she walked inside. The place was well lit, and the floor was light stone – somewhere between light yellow and camel-brown, like the colour of an old page – but the windows she had seen on the outside weren’t there on the inside. In fact, even though she had only taken a few steps forward she could no longer see the walls at all. Instead, there were bookshelves. Aisles and aisles of shelves, reaching up to the ceiling and branching off from the broad open corridor Nora was walking down. She turned down one of the aisles and stopped to gaze in bafflement at the seemingly endless amount of books.\n\nThe books were everywhere, on shelves so thin they might as well have been invisible. The books were all green. Greens of multifarious shades. Some of these volumes were a murky swamp green, some a bright and light chartreuse, some a bold emerald and others the verdant shade of summer lawns.\n\nAnd on the subject of summer lawns: despite the fact that the books looked old, the air in the library felt fresh. It had a lush, grassy, outdoors kind of smell, not the dusty scent of old tomes.\n\nThe shelves really did seem to go on for ever, straight and long towards a far-off horizon, like lines indicating one-point perspective in a school art project, broken only by the occasional corridor.\n\nShe picked a corridor at random and set off. At the next turn, she took a left and became a little lost. She searched for a way out, but there was no sign of an exit. She attempted to retrace her steps towards the entrance, but it was impossible.\n\nEventually she had to conclude she wasn’t going to find the exit.\n\n‘This is abnormal,’ she said to herself, to find comfort in the sound of her own voice. ‘Definitely abnormal.’\n\nNora stopped and stepped closer to some of the books.\n\nThere were no titles or author names adorning the spines. Aside from the difference of shade, the only other variation was size: the books were of similar height but varied in width. Some had spines two inches wide, others significantly less. One or two weren’t much more than pamphlets.\n\nShe reached to pull out one of the books, choosing a medium-sized one in a slightly drab olive colour. It looked a bit dusty and worn.\n\nBefore she had pulled it clean from the shelf, she heard a voice behind her and she jumped back.\n\n‘Be careful,’ the voice said.\n\nAnd Nora turned around to see who was there."}]}

On the little prince's planet the flowers had always been very simple. They had only one ring of petals; they took up no room at all; they were a trouble to nobody. One morning they would appear in the grass, and by night they would have faded peacefully away. But one day, from a seed blown from no one knew where, a new flower had come up; and the little prince had watched very closely over this small sprout which was not like any other small sprouts on his planet. It might, you see, have been a new kind of baobab.\n\n\n\nThe shrub soon stopped growing, and began to get ready to produce a flower. The little prince, who was present at the first appearance of a huge bud, felt at once that some sort of miraculous apparition must emerge from it. But the flower was not satisfied to complete the preparations for her beauty in the shelter of her green chamber. She chose her colors with the greatest care. She dressed herself slowly. She adjusted her petals one by one. She did not wish to go out into the world all rumpled, like the field poppies. It was only in the full radiance of her beauty that she wished to appear. Oh, yes! She was a coquettish creature! And her mysterious adornment lasted for days and days.\n\nThen one morning, exactly at sunrise, she suddenly showed herself.\n\n\nAnd, after working with all this painstaking precision, she yawned and said:\n\n'Ah! I am scarcely awake. I beg that you will excuse me. My petals are still all disarranged . . .'\n\nBut the little prince could not restrain his admiration:\n\n'Oh! How beautiful you are!'\n\n'Am I not?' the flower responded, sweetly. 'And I was born at the same moment as the sun . . .'\n\nThe little prince could guess easily enough that she was not any too modest--but how moving--and exciting--she was!\n\n'I think it is time for breakfast,' she added an instant later. 'If you would have the kindness to think of my needs--'\n\nAnd the little prince, completely abashed, went to look for a sprinkling-can of fresh water. So, he tended the flower.\n\n\nSo, too, she began very quickly to torment him with her vanity--which was, if the truth be known, a little difficult to deal with. One day, for instance, when she was speaking of her four thorns, she said to the little prince:\n\n'Let the tigers come with their claws!'\n\n\n\n'There are no tigers on my planet,' the little prince objected. 'And, anyway, tigers do not eat weeds.'\n\n'I am not a weed,' the flower replied, sweetly.\n\n'Please excuse me . . .'\n\n'I am not at all afraid of tigers,' she went on, 'but I have a horror of drafts. I suppose you wouldn't have a screen for me?'\n\n\n\n'A horror of drafts--that is bad luck, for a plant,' remarked the little prince, and added to himself, 'This flower is a very complex creature . . .'\n\n'At night I want you to put me under a glass globe. It is very cold where you live. In the place I came from--'\n\nBut she interrupted herself at that point. She had come in the form of a seed. She could not have known anything of any other worlds. Embarassed over having let herself be caught on the verge of such a naïve untruth, she coughed two or three times, in order to put the little prince in the wrong.\n\n'The screen?'\n\n'I was just going to look for it when you spoke to me . . .'\n\nThen she forced her cough a little more so that he should suffer from remorse just the same.\n\nSo the little prince, in spite of all the good will that was inseparable from his love, had soon come to doubt her. He had taken seriously words which were without importance, and it made him very unhappy.\n\n\n\n'I ought not to have listened to her,' he confided to me one day. 'One never ought to listen to the flowers. One should simply look at them and breathe their fragrance. Mine perfumed all my planet. But I did not know how to take pleasure in all her grace. This tale of claws, which disturbed me so much, should only have filled my heart with tenderness and pity.'\n\nAnd he continued his confidences:\n\n'The fact is that I did not know how to understand anything! I ought to have judged by deeds and not by words. She cast her fragrance and her radiance over me. I ought never to have run away from her . . . I ought to have guessed all the affection that lay behind her poor little strategems. Flowers are so inconsistent! But I was too young to know how to love her . . .'\n\n "}]}

You have to be careful.’\n\nThe woman had arrived seemingly from nowhere. Smartly dressed, with short grey hair and a turtle-green polo neck jumper. About sixty, if Nora had to pin it down.\n\n‘Who are you?’\n\nBut before she had finished the question, she realised she already knew the answer.\n\n‘I’m the librarian,’ the woman said, coyly. ‘That is who.’\n\nHer face was one of kind but stern wisdom. She had the same neat cropped grey hair she’d always had, with a face that looked precisely as it always did in Nora’s mind.\n\nFor there, right in front of her, was her old school librarian.\n\n‘Mrs Elm.’\n\nMrs Elm smiled, thinly. ‘Perhaps.’\n\nNora remembered those rainy afternoons, playing chess.\n\nShe remembered the day her father died, when Mrs Elm gently broke the news to her in the library. Her father had died suddenly of a heart attack while on the rugby field of the boys’ boarding school where he taught. She was numb for about half an hour, and had stared blankly at the unfinished game of chess. The reality was simply too big to absorb at first, but then it had hit her hard and sideways, taking her off the track she’d known. She had hugged Mrs Elm so close, crying into her polo neck until her face was raw from the fusion of tears and acrylic.\n\nMrs Elm had held her, stroking and smoothing the back of her head like a baby, not offering platitudes or false comforts or anything other than concern. She remembered Mrs Elm’s voice telling her at the time: ‘Things will get better, Nora. It’s going to be all right.’\n\nIt was over an hour before Nora’s mother came to pick her up, her brother stoned and numb in the backseat. And Nora had sat in the front next to her mute, trembling mother, saying that she loved her, but hearing nothing back.\n\n‘What is this place? Where am I?’\n\nMrs Elm smiled a very formal kind of smile. ‘A library, of course.’\n\n‘It’s not the school library. And there’s no exit. Am I dead? Is this the afterlife?’\n\n‘Not exactly,’ said Mrs Elm.\n\n‘I don’t understand.’\n\n‘Then let me explain.’"}]}
