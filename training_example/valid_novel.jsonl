In the end, Alice wakes up from her dream and realizes it was all just a dream.\n\nStory so far:  Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a novel by Lewis Carroll. It tells the story of Alice, who falls down a rabbit hole into a fantastical world populated by strange creatures. The novel features such classic scenes as the Mad Hatter's tea party and the Queen's croquet game. Alice gets bored sitting by her sister and sees a white rabbit with a pocket watch. She chases it and falls down a rabbit hole. Alice falls down a very deep well, and has plenty of time to look around as she falls. She sees that the well is filled with shelves and cupboards, and takes down a jar of orange marmalade. She wonders how far she has fallen and if she will ever reach the bottom. Alice is falling down a rabbit hole and wonders aloud about the different things she's passing. She wonders if she'll fall all the way through the earth and come out in Australia or New Zealand. Alice gets sleepy and continues to talk to herself. Alice falls asleep and dreams that she is talking to Dinah, her cat. In the dream, she asks Dinah if she has ever eaten a bat. Suddenly, Alice wakes up and finds herself in a long, dark hallway. She sees a small table with a golden key on it and tries to use the key to unlock one of the doors in the hallway, but it doesn't work. Alice is sad and wonders how she will ever get out of the hallway.\n\nLast chunk: a dreamy sort of way, \u201cDo cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?\u201d and sometimes, \u201cDo bats eat cats?\u201d for, you see, as she couldn\u2019t answer either question, it didn\u2019t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, \u201cNow, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?\u201d when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.  Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, \u201cOh my ears and whiskers, how late it\u2019s getting!\u201d She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.  There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.  Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice\u2019s first thought was that it might belong to one of the\n\nNext chunk:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!  Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; \u201cand even if my head would go through,\u201d thought poor Alice, \u201cit would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.\u201d For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.  There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (\u201cwhich certainly was not here before,\u201d said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words \u201cDRINK ME,\u201d beautifully printed on it in"}]}

Alice finds a bottle labeled \"Drink Me\" and decides to take a sip. She shrinks down to ten inches tall and is excited to enter the garden through the small door. Alice is worried that she might go out like a candle, and wonders what she would be like then. She tries to imagine what a candle's flame looks like after the candle is blown out, but she can't remember ever having seen such a thing.\n\nAlice decides to go into the garden, but she forgets the key and can't reach it. She gets tired and sits down to cry.\n\nAlice tells herself to stop crying and that it's no use to pretend to be two people. She thinks that there's hardly enough of her left to make one respectable person. Alice finds a cake that makes her grow larger, and she uses it to reach a key that will allow her into the garden. Alice is planning to be kind to her feet by giving them new boots for Christmas, but she finds it difficult to do so. She eventually meets the White Rabbit, who is dressed splendidly.\n\nLast chunk: great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;\u2014but I must be kind to them,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cor perhaps they won\u2019t walk the way I want to go!

Oh dear, what nonsense I\u2019m talking!\u201d  Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.  Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.  \u201cYou ought to be ashamed of yourself,\u201d said Alice, \u201ca great girl like you,\u201d (she might well say this), \u201cto go on crying in this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!\u201d But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.

The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. \u201cOh, I beg your pardon!\u201d cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal\u2019s feelings. \u201cI quite forgot you didn\u2019t like cats.\u201d  \u201cNot like cats!\u201d cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. \u201cWould _you_ like cats if you were me?\u201d  \u201cWell, perhaps not,\u201d said Alice in a soothing tone: \u201cdon\u2019t be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you\u2019d take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.

There was exactly one a-piece, all round.  \u201cBut she must have a prize herself, you know,\u201d said the Mouse.  \u201cOf course,\u201d the Dodo replied very gravely. \u201cWhat else have you got in your pocket?\u201d he went on, turning to Alice.  \u201cOnly a thimble,\u201d said Alice sadly.  \u201cHand it over here,\u201d said the Dodo.  Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble, saying \u201cWe beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble;\u201d and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.  Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she could.  The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.

Alice finds a house with a brass plate that says \"W. Rabbit\" and goes in. She finds a room with a fan and gloves and picks them up. She also finds a bottle and drinks from it. Alice drank from a magic bottle and grew until she was too large for the room. She was uncomfortable and wished she could go home.\n\nLast chunk: did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken.

I think that will be the best plan.\u201d  It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry.  An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. \u201cPoor little thing!\u201d said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.

It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their heads.

The highest form of criticism is autobiography. The author argues that books cannot be judged as morally good or bad, but only as well-written or badly-written. Art is a surface and symbol that can be interpreted in different ways, and the fact that critics often disagree about a work of art shows that it is complex and vital. This passage discusses the uselessness of art, and how it is only excusable if the artist admires it intensely. It also describes the atmosphere in a studio, with the scent of roses and the sound of bees. Basil Hallward is looking at a portrait of a young man that he has painted, and Lord Henry compliments him on it. Basil says that he doesn't want to send it to any art galleries.\n\nLast chunk: organ.  In the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the full-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty, and in front of it, some little distance away, was sitting the artist himself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some years ago caused, at the time, such public excitement and gave rise to so many strange conjectures.  As the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so skilfully mirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his face, and seemed about to linger there. But he suddenly started up, and closing his eyes, placed his fingers upon the lids, as though he sought to imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he feared he might awake.  \u201cIt is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done,\u201d said Lord Henry languidly. \u201cYou must certainly send it next year to the Grosvenor.

It is silly of you, for there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.

Lord Henry is surprised but accepts this, and the two men continue to talk.\n\nLast chunk: occasion. It is not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on the coloured canvas, reveals himself.

Perhaps you will hardly believe it.\u201d  Lord Henry smiled, and leaning down, plucked a pink-petalled daisy from the grass and examined it. \u201cI am quite sure I shall understand it,\u201d he replied, gazing intently at the little golden, white-feathered disk, \u201cand as for believing things, I can believe anything, provided that it is quite incredible.\u201d  The wind shook some blossoms from the trees, and the heavy lilac-blooms, with their clustering stars, moved to and fro in the languid air. A grasshopper began to chirrup by the wall, and like a blue thread a long thin dragon-fly floated past on its brown gauze wings. Lord Henry felt as if he could hear Basil Hallward\u2019s heart beating, and wondered what was coming.  \u201cThe story is simply this,\u201d said the painter after some time. \u201cTwo months ago I went to a crush at Lady Brandon\u2019s.

That is the second time you have made that observation. If one puts forward an idea to a true Englishman\u2014always a rash thing to do\u2014he never dreams of considering whether the idea is right or wrong. The only thing he considers of any importance is whether one believes it oneself. Now, the value of an idea has nothing whatsoever to do with the sincerity of the man who expresses it.

There was a rustle of chirruping sparrows in the green lacquer leaves of the ivy, and the blue cloud-shadows chased themselves across the grass like swallows. How pleasant it was in the garden! And how delightful other people\u2019s emotions were!\u2014much more delightful than their ideas, it seemed to him. One\u2019s own soul, and the passions of one\u2019s friends\u2014those were the fascinating things in life. He pictured to himself with silent amusement the tedious luncheon that he had missed by staying so long with Basil Hallward. Had he gone to his aunt\u2019s, he would have been sure to have met Lord Goodbody there, and the whole conversation would have been about the feeding of the poor and the necessity for model lodging-houses. Each class would have preached the importance of those virtues, for whose exercise there was no necessity in their own lives. The rich would have spoken on the value of thrift, and the idle grown eloquent over the dignity of labour. It was charming to have escaped all that! As he thought of his aunt, an idea seemed to strike him.

He does not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His virtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such things as sins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of some one else\u2019s music, an actor of a part that has not been written for him. The aim of life is self-development. To realize one\u2019s nature perfectly\u2014that is what each of us is here for. People are afraid of themselves, nowadays. They have forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to one\u2019s self. Of course, they are charitable. They feed the hungry and clothe the beggar. But their own souls starve, and are naked. Courage has gone out of our race. Perhaps we never really had it.

Nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure, or the luxury of a regret. The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful.

They moved, as he spoke, like music, and seemed to have a language of their own. But he felt afraid of him, and ashamed of being afraid. Why had it been left for a stranger to reveal him to himself? He had known Basil Hallward for months, but the friendship between them had never altered him.

He stood there motionless and in wonder, dimly conscious that Hallward was speaking to him, but not catching the meaning of his words. The sense of his own beauty came on him like a revelation. He had never felt it before. Basil Hallward\u2019s compliments had seemed to him to be merely the charming exaggeration of friendship. He had listened to them, laughed at them, forgotten them. They had not influenced his nature. Then had come Lord Henry Wotton with his strange panegyric on youth, his terrible warning of its brevity.

The author is discussing their motivations for embarking on a voyage to the North Pole, and how they hope to make various discoveries that will benefit all of humanity. They conclude by expressing their excitement for the journey ahead. The speaker recalls how, as a child, they were fascinated by their uncle's library of books on voyages of discovery. Despite their education being neglected, they read these books avidly and dreamed of going on such voyages themselves. These dreams faded when they discovered poetry and realized that they could have their own niche in the world of literature. However, when they inherited their cousin's fortune, they decided to pursue their earlier dream of going on a great voyage of discovery. For this, they trained their body to endure hardship and studied various sciences.\n\nLast chunk: remember that a history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the whole of our good Uncle Thomas\u2019 library.

These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven. I also became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation; I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the names of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated.

I accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea; I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those branches of physical science from which a naval\n\nNext chunk:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "adventurer might derive the greatest practical advantage.

Instead of being the warm centre of the world, the Middle West now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe\u2014so I decided to go East and learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I supposed it could support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said, \u201cWhy\u2014ye-es,\u201d with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance me for a year, and after various delays I came East, permanently, I thought, in the spring of twenty-two.  The practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm season, and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town, it sounded like a great idea.

He reflects on how different the East Coast felt from the Midwest and how he enjoyed his time there. The narrator moves to the country alone, but soon meets a man who makes him feel less lonely. He buys books on finance and plans to read them over the summer. The passage describes the author's experience living in one of the \"strangest communities in North America\" - two large eggs shaped islands off the coast of Long Island. The author lived on the less fashionable of the two islands, West Egg. The passage describes Gatsby's mansion and the Buchanans' house across the water. The narrator reflects on how he used to know Tom in college and how Tom and Daisy have become much wealthier since then. The narrator wonders why they came East. The passage describes a wealthy man named Tom Buchanan, who has changed since the narrator last saw him. He is now arrogant and has a commanding presence. The narrator is visiting his home, which is an elaborate mansion. Tom is standing on the porch, and the narrator can see that he is a very powerful man.\n\nLast chunk: in France for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together.

And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all. Their house was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red-and-white Georgian Colonial mansion, overlooking the bay. The lawn started at the beach and ran towards the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sundials and brick walks and burning gardens\u2014finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run. The front was broken by a line of French windows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm windy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch.  He had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a sturdy straw-haired man of thirty, with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner.

She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with an erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young cadet.

However, Gatsby's life is not as perfect as it seems, and Nick soon learns that he is involved in a love affair with the beautiful Daisy Buchanan. As the story unfolds, Nick finds himself caught up in the world of the rich and famous, and he must choose between his new lifestyle and his old values.\n\nStory so far: The passage describes a summer night in New York, and the figure of Mr. Gatsby, who is standing alone and looking out at the stars. The narrator decides not to call out to him, and Gatsby soon vanishes back into the shadows. The passage also describes a desolate area of land known as the valley of ashes, where ashes take the form of houses and chimneys and where ash-grey men move dimly through the powdery air. Myrtle Wilson is unhappy in her marriage and regrets ever marrying her husband. She says she only married him because she thought he was a gentleman, but he has turned out to be anything but. Myrtle's husband has been having an affair with Catherine's husband, Tom, and Myrtle says she is the first sweetie he's ever had. The passage describes the narrator's feelings of being both inside and outside of the conversations going on around him. He is pulled back into his chair by the argument, but he sees someone else looking up at the building. Myrtle tells the story of her first meeting with Tom.

Mr. Bennet is not interested in meeting Mr. Bingley, but his wife insists that they do so. Mr. Bennet is over scrupulous and is preventing Mr. Bingley from marrying one of his daughters. He is concerned that they are all silly and ignorant, but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters.

Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by       an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House. He did       look at it, and into it for half an hour, was pleased with the       situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner       said in its praise, and took it immediately.

Much to the author\u2019s surprise, and (if he may say so without additional offence) considerably to his amusement, he finds that his sketch of official life, introductory to THE SCARLET LETTER, has created an unprecedented excitement in the respectable community immediately around him. It could hardly have been more violent, indeed, had he burned down the Custom-House, and quenched its last smoking ember in the blood of a certain venerable personage, against whom he is supposed to cherish a peculiar malevolence. As the public disapprobation would weigh very heavily on him, were he conscious of deserving it, the author begs leave to say, that he has carefully read over the introductory pages, with a purpose to alter or expunge whatever might be found amiss, and to make the best reparation in his power for the atrocities of which he has been adjudged guilty. But it appears to him, that the only remarkable features of the sketch are its frank and genuine good-humor, and the general accuracy with which he has conveyed his sincere impressions of the characters therein described.

The author of The Scarlet Letter was surprised and amused to find that his sketch of official life in the preface to the second edition had caused an unprecedented amount of excitement among the respectable people around him. He insists that he did not mean to offend anyone and that the sketch was simply meant to be a frank and accurate portrayal of his impressions of the characters described therein. The author of \"The Custom House\" republishes his introductory sketch without changes, noting that he believes he has done so in the best possible way. The contents of the book are then listed. The passage describes the different illustrations in the book. The narrator talks about how he twice felt the need to write about his life, once when he was living in the Old Manse, and now again. He talks about how he has always been reticent to talk about himself, but feels compelled to do so now. The author talks about his experience working in a custom house, and how he feels that he has to keep a part of himself hidden from the world.\n\nLast chunk: my deserts, I was happy enough to find a listener or two on the former occasion\u2014I again seize the public by the button, and talk of my three years\u2019 experience in a Custom-House. The example of the famous \u201cP. P., Clerk of this Parish,\u201d was never more faithfully followed. The truth seems to be, however, that, when he casts his leaves forth upon the wind, the author addresses, not the many who will fling aside his volume, or never take it up, but the few who will understand him, better than most of his schoolmates or lifemates. Some authors, indeed, do far more than this, and indulge themselves in such confidential depths of revelation as could fittingly be addressed, only and exclusively, to the one heart and mind of perfect sympathy; as if the printed book, thrown at large on the wide world, were certain to find out the divided segment of the writer\u2019s own nature, and complete his circle of existence by bringing him into communion with it. It is scarcely decorous, however, to speak all, even where we speak impersonally. But, as thoughts are frozen and utterance benumbed, unless the speaker stand in some true relation with his audience, it may be pardonable to imagine that a friend, a kind and apprehensive, though not the closest friend, is listening to our talk; and then, a native reserve being thawed by this genial consciousness, we may prate of the circumstances that lie around us, and even of ourself, but still keep the inmost Me behind its veil.

This passage describes the arrival of ships at Salem's port, and the bustle that ensues. The port is not as busy as it used to be, but on days when several ships arrive at once, there is a lot of activity. The people who come to the port include the shipmasters and the ship owners. This passage describes the various people who would be found at the Custom House in the early 19th century. Among them were the young clerk, the outward-bound sailor, the recently arrived one, the captains of the rusty little schooners, and the venerable figures in old-fashioned chairs. The passage describes a room in a seaport town, inhabited by old men who are retired Custom-House officers. The room is dirty and cluttered, and it is clear that it is not regularly cleaned.\n\nLast chunk: snore, and with that lack of energy that distinguishes the occupants of almshouses, and all other human beings who depend for subsistence on charity, on monopolized labor, or anything else, but their own independent exertions. These old gentlemen\u2014seated, like Matthew, at the receipt of customs, but not very liable to be summoned thence, like him, for apostolic errands\u2014were Custom-House officers.  Furthermore, on the left hand as you enter the front door, is a certain room or office, about fifteen feet square, and of a lofty height; with two of its arched windows commanding a view of the aforesaid dilapidated wharf, and the third looking across a narrow lane, and along a portion of Derby Street. All three give glimpses of the shops of grocers, block-makers, slop-sellers, and ship-chandlers; around the doors of which are generally to be seen, laughing and gossiping, clusters of old salts, and such other wharf-rats as haunt the Wapping of a seaport. The room itself is cobwebbed, and dingy with old paint; its floor is strewn with gray sand, in a fashion that has elsewhere fallen into long disuse; and it is easy to conclude, from the general slovenliness of the place, that this is a sanctuary into which womankind, with her tools of magic, the broom and mop, has very infrequent access. In the way of furniture, there is a stove with a voluminous funnel; an old pine desk, with a three-legged stool beside it; two or three wooden-bottom chairs, exceedingly decrepit and infirm; and\u2014not\n\nNext chunk:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "to forget the library\u2014on some shelves, a score or two of volumes of the Acts of Congress, and a bulky Digest of the Revenue Laws.

This passage describes the connection that a family has to a specific location, even if they have no personal attachment to the place. This is because the family has likely been living in the same place for generations, and the connection is passed down through the family.\n\nLast chunk: generations, performing any memorable deed, or so much as putting forward a claim to public notice. Gradually, they have sunk almost out of sight; as old houses, here and there about the streets, get covered half-way to the eaves by the accumulation of new soil. From father to son, for above a hundred years, they followed the sea; a gray-headed shipmaster, in each generation, retiring from the quarter-deck to the homestead, while a boy of fourteen took the hereditary place before the mast, confronting the salt spray and the gale, which had blustered against his sire and grandsire. The boy, also, in due time, passed from the forecastle to the cabin, spent a tempestuous manhood, and returned from his world-wanderings, to grow old, and die, and mingle his dust with the natal earth. This long connection of a family with one spot, as its place of birth and burial, creates a kindred between the human being and the locality, quite independent of any charm in the scenery or moral circumstances that surround him. It is not love, but instinct. The new inhabitant\u2014who came himself from a foreign land, or whose father or grandfather came\u2014has little claim to be called a Salemite; he has no conception of the oyster-like tenacity with which an old settler, over whom his third century is creeping, clings to the spot where his successive generations have been imbedded.

I felt it almost as a destiny to make Salem my home; so that the mould of features and cast of character which had all along been familiar here,\u2014ever, as one representative of the race lay down in his grave, another assuming, as it were, his sentry-march along the main street,\u2014might still in my little day be seen and recognized in the old town. Nevertheless, this very sentiment is an evidence that the connection, which has become an unhealthy one, should at last be severed. Human nature will not flourish, any more than a potato, if it be planted and replanted, for too long a series of generations, in the same worn-out soil. My children have had other birthplaces, and, so far as their fortunes may be within my control, shall strike their roots into unaccustomed earth.  On emerging from the Old Manse, it was chiefly this strange, indolent, unjoyous attachment for my native town, that brought me to fill a place in Uncle Sam\u2019s brick edifice, when I might as well, or better, have gone somewhere else.

I knew it too, but could never quite find in my heart to act upon the knowledge. Much and deservedly to my own discredit, therefore, and considerably to the detriment of my official conscience, they continued, during my incumbency, to creep about the wharves, and loiter up and down the Custom-House steps. They spent a good deal of time, also, asleep in their accustomed corners, with their chairs tilted back against the wall; awaking, however, once or twice in a forenoon, to bore one another with the several thousandth repetition of old sea-stories, and mouldy jokes, that had grown to be passwords and countersigns among them.  The discovery was soon made, I imagine, that the new Surveyor had no great harm in him. So, with lightsome hearts, and the happy consciousness of being usefully employed,\u2014in their own behalf, at least, if not for our beloved country,\u2014these good old gentlemen went through the various formalities of office. Sagaciously, under their spectacles, did they peep into the holds of vessels! Mighty was their fuss about little matters, and marvellous, sometimes, the obtuseness that allowed greater ones to slip between their fingers! Whenever such a mischance occurred,\u2014when a wagon-load of valuable merchandise had been smuggled ashore, at noonday, perhaps, and directly beneath their unsuspicious noses,\u2014nothing could exceed the vigilance and\n\nNext chunk:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "alacrity with which they proceeded to lock, and double-lock, and secure with tape and sealing-wax, all the avenues of the delinquent vessel.

Unless people are more than commonly disagreeable, it is my foolish habit to contract a kindness for them. The better part of my companion\u2019s character, if it have a better part, is that which usually comes uppermost in my regard, and forms the type whereby I recognize the man. As most of these old Custom-House officers had good traits, and as my position in reference to them, being paternal and protective, was favorable to the growth of friendly sentiments, I soon grew to like them all. It was pleasant, in the summer forenoons,\u2014when the fervent heat, that almost liquefied the rest of the human family, merely communicated a genial warmth to their half-torpid systems,\u2014it was pleasant to hear them chatting in the back entry, a row of them all tipped against the wall, as usual; while the frozen witticisms of past generations were thawed out, and came bubbling with laughter from their lips.

The passage describes a man who seems to the narrator to be little more than a animal, existing only to satisfy his appetites. However, the man is also cunning and content with his life, and the narrator finds him strangely likable.\n\nLast chunk: with, I think, livelier curiosity, than any other form of humanity there presented to my notice. He was, in truth, a rare phenomenon; so perfect, in one point of view; so shallow, so delusive, so impalpable, such an absolute nonentity, in every other. My conclusion was that he had no soul, no heart, no mind; nothing, as I have already said, but instincts: and yet, withal, so cunningly had the few materials of his character been put together, that there was no painful perception of deficiency, but, on my part, an entire contentment with what I found in him. It might be difficult\u2014and it was so\u2014to conceive how he should exist hereafter, so earthly and sensuous did he seem; but surely his existence here, admitting that it was to terminate with his last breath, had been not unkindly given; with no higher moral responsibilities than the beasts of the field, but with a larger scope of enjoyment than theirs, and with all their blessed immunity from the dreariness and duskiness of age.  One point, in which he had vastly the advantage over his four-footed brethren, was his ability to recollect the good dinners which it had made no small portion of the happiness of his life to eat. His gourmandism was a highly agreeable trait; and to hear him talk of roast-meat was as appetizing as a pickle or an oyster.

There were flavors on his palate that had lingered there not less than sixty or seventy years, and were still apparently as fresh as that of the mutton-chop which he had just devoured for his breakfast. I have heard him smack his lips over dinners, every guest at which, except himself, had long been food for worms. It was marvellous to observe how the ghosts of bygone meals were continually rising up before him; not in anger or retribution, but as if grateful for his former appreciation and seeking to resuscitate an endless series of enjoyment, at once shadowy and sensual. A tender-loin of beef, a hind-quarter of veal, a spare-rib of pork, a particular chicken, or a remarkably praiseworthy turkey, which had perhaps adorned his board in the days of the elder Adams, would be remembered; while all the subsequent experience of our race, and all the events that brightened or darkened his individual career, had gone over him with as little permanent effect as the passing breeze.

And, in so intense a moment, his demeanor would have still been calm. Such an exhibition, however, was but to be pictured in fancy; not to be anticipated, nor desired. What I saw in him\u2014as evidently as the indestructible ramparts of Old Ticonderoga already cited as the most appropriate simile\u2014were the features of stubborn and ponderous endurance, which might well have amounted to obstinacy in his earlier days; of integrity, that, like most of his other endowments, lay in a somewhat heavy mass, and was just as unmalleable and unmanageable as a ton of iron ore; and of benevolence, which, fiercely as he led the bayonets on at Chippewa or Fort Erie, I take to be of quite as genuine a stamp as what actuates any or all the polemical philanthropists of the age. He had slain men with his own hand, for aught I know,\u2014certainly, they had fallen, like blades of grass at the sweep of the scythe, before the charge to which his spirit imparted its triumphant energy;\u2014but, be that as it might, there was never in his heart so much cruelty as would have brushed the down off a butterfly\u2019s wing.

Still, even in respect of grace and beauty, there were points well worth noting. A ray of humor, now and then, would make its way through the veil of dim obstruction, and glimmer pleasantly upon our faces. A trait of native elegance, seldom seen in the masculine character after childhood or early youth, was shown in the General\u2019s fondness for the sight and fragrance of flowers.

The passage also describes the importance of interacting with people who are different from oneself, in order to develop a better understanding of the world. The passage describes the author's shift away from an interest in literature and toward an interest in nature. He notes that this change was brought about by his interactions with different people, each of whom had their own unique perspective.\n\nLast chunk: those wild, free days on the Assabeth, indulging fantastic speculations, beside our fire of fallen boughs, with Ellery Channing; after talking with Thoreau about pine-trees and Indian relics, in his hermitage at Walden; after growing fastidious by sympathy with the classic refinement of Hillard\u2019s culture; after becoming imbued with poetic sentiment at Longfellow\u2019s hearthstone;\u2014it was time, at length, that I should exercise other faculties of my nature, and nourish myself with food for which I had hitherto had little appetite. Even the old Inspector was desirable, as a change of diet, to a man who had known Alcott. I look upon it as an evidence, in some measure, of a system naturally well balanced, and lacking no essential part of a thorough organization, that, with such associates to remember, I could mingle at once with men of altogether different qualities, and never murmur at the change.  Literature, its exertions and objects, were now of little moment in my regard. I cared not, at this period, for books; they were apart from me. Nature,\u2014except it were human nature,\u2014the nature that is developed in earth and sky, was, in one sense, hidden from me; and all the imaginative delight, wherewith it had been spiritualized, passed away out of my mind.

There was always a prophetic instinct, a low whisper in my ear, that, within no long period, and whenever a new change of custom should be essential to my good, a change would come.

A Tale of Two Cities is a story of the French Revolution by Charles Dickens. The novel tells the story of the French Revolution through the eyes of several different characters. Some of the characters are on the side of the revolution, while others are against it. The novel shows the different ways that people react to the violence and chaos of the revolution. This passage compares the winter of 1775 to the present day, noting that both periods had their share of problems. In particular, the author highlights the fact that there were prophecies of bad things happening in both periods, but in the end, these prophecies did not come to fruition. The passage describes the French Revolution, during which many people were sentenced to brutal punishments for relatively minor offenses. It notes that even though the events of the Revolution were horrific, they were ultimately overseen by forces of nature that are indifferent to human suffering. This passage describes the lawlessness and violence that were commonplace in England at the time. The passage describes the Dover road in England in the year 1775. The road is full of criminals and dead bodies, and the narrator refers to the people who travel on it as \"the creatures of this chronicle.\"\n\nLast chunk: hangman, ever busy and ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing up long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in the hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the door of Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer, and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer\u2019s boy of sixpence.  All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and close upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five. Environed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheeded, those two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain and the fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights with a high hand. Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five conduct their Greatnesses, and myriads of small creatures--the creatures of this chronicle among the rest--along the roads that lay before them.     CHAPTER II. The Mail   It was the Dover road that lay, on a Friday night late in November, before the first of the persons with whom this history has business. The Dover road lay, as to him, beyond the Dover mail, as it lumbered up Shooter\u2019s Hill. He walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail, as the rest of the passengers did; not because they had the least relish for walking exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill, and the harness, and the mud,\n\nNext chunk:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "and the mail, were all so heavy, that the horses had three times already come to a stop, besides once drawing the coach across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back to Blackheath.

With drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed their way through the thick mud, floundering and stumbling between whiles, as if they were falling to pieces at the larger joints.

Whenever the leader made this rattle, the passenger started, as a nervous passenger might, and was disturbed in mind.  There was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in its forlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding none. A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through the air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the waves of an unwholesome sea might do. It was dense enough to shut out everything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own workings, and a few yards of road; and the reek of the labouring"}]}

The rider stooped, and, casting up his eyes at the guard, handed the passenger a small folded paper. The rider\u2019s horse was blown, and both horse and rider were covered with mud, from the hoofs of the horse to the hat of the man.  \u201cGuard!\u201d said the passenger, in a tone of quiet business confidence.  The watchful guard, with his right hand at the stock of his raised blunderbuss, his left at the barrel, and his eye on the horseman, answered curtly, \u201cSir.\u201d  \u201cThere is nothing to apprehend. I belong to Tellson\u2019s Bank. You must know Tellson\u2019s Bank in London. I am going to Paris on business. A crown to drink.

Make the best of your way. Good night.\u201d  With those words the passenger opened the coach-door and got in; not at all assisted by his fellow-passengers, who had expeditiously secreted their watches and purses in their boots, and were now making a general pretence of being asleep. With no more definite purpose than to escape the hazard of originating any other kind of action."}]}

Except on the crown, which was raggedly bald, he had stiff, black hair, standing jaggedly all over it, and growing down hill almost to his broad, blunt nose. It was so like Smith\u2019s work, so much more like the top of a strongly spiked wall than a head of hair, that the best of players at leap-frog might have declined him, as the most dangerous man in the world to go over.  While he trotted back with the message he was to deliver to the night watchman in his box at the door of Tellson\u2019s Bank, by Temple Bar, who was to deliver it to greater authorities within, the shadows of the night took such shapes to him as arose out of the message, and took such shapes to the mare as arose out of _her_ private topics of uneasiness. They seemed to be numerous, for she shied at every shadow on the road.  What time, the mail-coach lumbered, jolted, rattled, and bumped upon its tedious way, with its three fellow-inscrutables inside. To whom, likewise, the shadows of the night revealed themselves, in the forms their dozing eyes and wandering thoughts suggested.  Tellson\u2019s Bank had a run upon it in the mail.

The rattle of the harness was the chink of money, and more drafts were honoured in five minutes than even Tellson\u2019s, with all its foreign and home connection, ever paid in thrice the time. Then the strong-rooms underground, at Tellson\u2019s, with such of their valuable stores and secrets as were known to the passenger (and it was not a little that he knew about them), opened before him, and he went in among them with the great keys and the feebly-burning candle, and found them safe, and strong, and sound, and still, just as he had last seen them.  But, though the bank was almost always with him, and though the coach (in a confused way, like the presence of pain under an opiate) was always with him, there was another current of impression that never ceased to run, all through the night. He was on his way to dig some one out of a grave.  Now, which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before him was the true face of the buried person, the shadows of the night did not indicate; but they were all the faces of a man of five-and-forty by years, and they differed"}]}

Stir about there, now, for Concord!\u201d  The Concord bed-chamber being always assigned to a passenger by the mail, and passengers by the mail being always heavily wrapped up from head to foot, the room had the odd interest for the establishment of the Royal George, that although but one kind of man was seen to go into it, all kinds and varieties of men came out of it. Consequently, another drawer, and two porters, and several maids and the landlady, were all loitering by accident at various points of the road between the Concord and the coffee-room, when a gentleman of sixty, formally dressed in a brown suit of clothes, pretty well worn, but very well kept, with large square cuffs and large flaps to the pockets, passed along on his way to his breakfast.  The coffee-room had no other occupant, that forenoon, than the gentleman in brown. His breakfast-table was drawn before the fire, and as he sat, with its light shining on him, waiting for the meal, he sat so still, that he might have been sitting for his portrait.  Very orderly and methodical he looked, with a hand on each knee, and a loud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his flapped waist-coat, as though it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity and evanescence of the brisk fire. He had a good leg, and was a little vain of it, for his brown stockings fitted sleek and close, and were of a fine texture; his shoes and buckles, too, though plain, were trim. He wore an odd little\n\nNext chunk:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "sleek crisp flaxen wig, setting very close to his head: which wig, it is to be presumed, was made of hair, but which looked far more as though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass. His linen, though not of a fineness in accordance with his stockings, was as white as the tops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring beach, or the specks of sail that glinted in the sunlight far at sea. A face habitually suppressed and quieted, was still lighted up under the quaint wig by a pair of moist bright eyes that it must have cost their owner, in years gone by, some pains to drill to the composed and reserved expression of Tellson\u2019s Bank. He had a healthy colour in his cheeks, and his face, though lined, bore few traces of anxiety. But, perhaps the confidential bachelor clerks in Tellson\u2019s Bank were principally occupied with the cares of other people; and perhaps second-hand cares, like second-hand clothes, come easily off and on.  Completing his resemblance to a man who was sitting for his portrait, Mr. Lorry dropped off to sleep. The arrival of his breakfast roused him, and he said to the drawer, as he moved his chair to it:  \u201cI wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come here at any time to-day.

The man wakes up and realizes it was all a dream. A young woman needs to go to Paris for business, and she asks a gentleman from the bank to accompany her. He agrees, and tells her that the business is of a surprising nature. A man tells a story about one of his customers, a French gentleman from Beauvais. The passage describes a man's lack of feelings and emotions, and how he has been a trustee for many customers over the years. He thinks that the person who brought him to England when he was orphaned was the same person who is sitting in front of him. The speaker is Mr. Lorry, an employee of Tellsons Bank. He is telling Miss Manette, the daughter of a former client of the bank, about her father's death. Mr. Lorry describes his own daily routine and explains that he has no time for emotions. He then tells Miss Manette that her father's death was not his fault. The passage tells the story of a man named Manette who was imprisoned unjustly.

Manette eventually escaped and found his way back to his wife and child.\n\nLast chunk: Manette had not died; if he had suddenly and silently disappeared; if he had been spirited away; if it had not been difficult to guess to what dreadful place, though no art could trace him; if he had an enemy in some compatriot who could exercise a privilege that I in my own time have known the boldest people afraid to speak of in a whisper, across the water there; for instance, the privilege of filling up blank forms for the consignment of any one to the oblivion of a prison for any length of time; if his wife had implored the king, the queen, the court, the clergy, for any tidings of him, and all quite in vain;--then the history of your father would have been the history of this unfortunate gentleman, the Doctor of Beauvais.\u201d  \u201cI entreat you to tell me more, sir.\u201d  \u201cI will.

Courage! Business! You have business before you; useful business. Miss Manette, your mother took this course with you. And when she died--I believe broken-hearted--having never slackened her unavailing search for your father, she left you, at two years old, to grow to be blooming, beautiful, and happy, without the dark cloud upon you of living in uncertainty whether your father soon wore his heart out in prison, or wasted there through many lingering years.\u201d  As he said the words he looked down, with an admiring pity, on the flowing golden hair; as if he pictured to himself that it might have been already tinged with grey.  \u201cYou"}]}

The story begins in 1775 and is set in London and Paris. The main characters are Dr. Manette, Lucie Manette, Charles Darnay, and Sydney Carton. Dr. Manette is a doctor who is released from prison after eighteen years. He is reunited with his daughter, Lucie, and they move to Paris. Charles Darnay is a French aristocrat who is accused of being a traitor and is sentenced to death. Sydney Carton is an English lawyer who defends Darnay and falls in love with Lucie. The story is a love story, a story of redemption, and a story of the French Revolution.\n\nStory so far: The passage describes a man's experience of seeing a ghost, which is actually a figment of his imagination. The man is tired and falls asleep, during which time he imagines the ghostly face of a person he once knew. This person was buried 18 years ago and the man imagines him coming back to life. The man wakes up and realizes it was all a dream. The passage describes a man who has been found alive after being presumed dead, and his daughter's reaction to the news. The daughter is shocked and disbelieved, and Mr. Lorry tries to comfort her. He tells her that her father has been found under a different name. The passage describes a woman who appears to be in a trance, and the man who is with her is worried that he will hurt her if he tries to move her. He calls for help, and a wild-looking woman comes over. A figure scolds the inn servants for not fetching things and orders them to bring smelling-salts, cold water, and vinegar. The figure tenderly cares for the patient, calling her \"my precious\" and \"my bird.\" The figure is angry with Mr. Lorry, accusing him of frightening the patient. A cask of wine has fallen and broken in the street, and people are taking advantage of the situation to drink as much of the wine as they can. Mr. Lorry, observing the scene, hopes that the young woman he is with will not be similarly tempted.\n\nLast chunk: not mentioned if they stayed there, staring, recovered her charge by a regular series of gradations, and coaxed her to lay her drooping head upon her shoulder.  \u201cI hope she will do well now,\u201d said Mr. Lorry.  \u201cNo thanks to you in brown, if she does. My darling pretty!\u201d  \u201cI hope,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, after another pause of feeble sympathy and humility, \u201cthat you accompany Miss Manette to France?\u201d  \u201cA likely thing, too!\u201d replied the strong woman. \u201cIf it was ever intended that I should go across salt water, do you suppose Providence would have cast my lot in an island?\u201d  This being another question hard to answer, Mr. Jarvis Lorry withdrew to consider it.     CHAPTER V. The Wine-shop   A large cask of wine had been dropped and broken, in the street. The accident had happened in getting it out of a cart; the cask had tumbled out with a run, the hoops had burst, and it lay on the stones just outside the door of the wine-shop, shattered like a walnut-shell.  All the people within reach had suspended their business, or their idleness, to run to the spot and drink the wine. The rough, irregular stones of the street, pointing every way, and designed, one might have thought, expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them, had dammed it into little pools; these were surrounded, each by its own jostling group or crowd, according to its size. Some men kneeled down, made scoops of their two hands joined, and sipped, or tried to help women, who bent over their shoulders, to sip,\n\nNext chunk:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "before the wine had all run out between their fingers. Others, men and women, dipped in the puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware, or even with handkerchiefs from women\u2019s heads, which were squeezed dry into infants\u2019 mouths; others made small mud-embankments, to stem the wine as it ran; others, directed by lookers-on up at high windows, darted here and there, to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new directions; others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee-dyed pieces of the cask, licking, and even champing the moister wine-rotted fragments with eager relish. There was no drainage to carry off the wine, and not only did it all get taken up, but so much mud got taken up along with it, that there might have been a scavenger in the street, if anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous presence.  A shrill sound of laughter and of amused voices--voices of men, women, and children--resounded in the street while this wine game lasted. There was little roughness in the sport, and much playfulness. There was a special companionship in it, an observable inclination on the part of every one to join some other one, which led, especially among the luckier or lighter-hearted, to frolicsome embraces, drinking of healths, shaking of hands, and even joining of hands and dancing, a dozen together. When the wine was gone, and the places where it had been most abundant were raked into a gridiron-pattern by fingers, these demonstrations"}]}
