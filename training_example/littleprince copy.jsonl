Something was broken in my engine. And as I had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone. It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week.\n\nThe first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation. I was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean. Thus you can imagine my amazement, at sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice. It said:\n\n'If you please--draw me a sheep!'\n\n'What!'\n\n'Draw me a sheep!'\n\nI jumped to my feet, completely thunderstruck. I blinked my eyes hard. I looked carefully all around me. And I saw a most extraordinary small person, who stood there examining me with great seriousness. Here you may see the best portrait that, later, I was able to make of him. But my drawing is certainly very much less charming than its model.\n\n\nThat, however, is not my fault. The grown-ups discouraged me in my painter's career when I was six years old, and I never learned to draw anything, except boas from the outside and boas from the inside.\n\nNow I stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly starting out of my head in astonishment. Remember, I had crashed in the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region. And yet my little man seemed neither to be straying uncertainly among the sands, nor to be fainting from fatigue or hunger or thirst or fear. Nothing about him gave any suggestion of a child lost in the middle of the desert, a thousand miles from any human habitation. When at last I was able to speak, I said to him:\n\n'But--what are you doing here?'\n\nAnd in answer he repeated, very slowly, as if he were speaking of a matter of great consequence:\n\n'If you please--draw me a sheep . . .'\n\nWhen a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not disobey. Absurd as it might seem to me, a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death, I took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and my fountain-pen. But then I remembered how my studies had been concentrated on geography, history, arithmetic and grammar, and I told the little chap (a little crossly, too) that I did not know how to draw. He answered me:\n\n'That doesn't matter. Draw me a sheep . . .'\n\nBut I had never drawn a sheep. So I drew for him one of the two pictures I had drawn so often. It was that of the boa constrictor from the outside. And I was astounded to hear the little fellow greet it with,\n\n'No, no, no! I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor. A boa constrictor is a very dangerous creature, and an elephant is very cumbersome. Where I live, everything is very small. What I need is a sheep. Draw me a sheep.'\n\nSo then I made a drawing.\n\n\nHe looked at it carefully, then he said:\n\n'No. This sheep is already very sickly. Make me another.'\n\nSo I made another drawing.\n\n\nMy friend smiled gently and indulgently.\n\n'You see yourself,' he said, 'that this is not a sheep. This is a ram. It has horns.'\n\nSo then I did my drawing over once more.\n\n\nBut it was rejected too, just like the others.\n\n'This one is too old. I want a sheep that will live a long time.'\n\nBy this time my patience was exhausted, because I was in a hurry to start taking my engine apart. So I tossed off this drawing.\n\n\nAnd I threw out an explanation with it.\n\n'This is only his box. The sheep you asked for is inside.'\n\nI was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young judge:\n\n'That is exactly the way I wanted it! Do you think that this sheep will have to have a great deal of grass?'\n\n'Why?'\n\n'Because where I live everything is very small . . .'\n\n'There will surely be enough grass for him,' I said. 'It is a very small sheep that I have given you.'\n\nHe bent his head over the drawing.\n\n'Not so small that--Look! He has gone to sleep . . .'\n\nAnd that is how I made the acquaintance of the little prince.\n\n"}]}

I knew very well that in addition to the great planets--such as the Earth, Jupiter, Mars, Venus--to which we have given names, there are also hundreds of others, some of which are so small that one has a hard time seeing them through the telescope. When an astronomer discovers one of these he does not give it a name, but only a number. He might call it, for example, 'Asteroid 325.'\n\n\n\nI have serious reason to believe that the planet from which the little prince came is the asteroid known as B-612.\n\nThis asteroid has only once been seen through the telescope. That was by a Turkish astronomer, in 1909.\n\n\nOn making his discovery, the astronomer had presented it to the International Astronomical Congress, in a great demonstration. But he was in Turkish costume, and so nobody would believe what he said.\n\nGrown-ups are like that . . .\n\nFortunately, however, for the reputation of Asteroid B-612, a Turkish dictator made a law that his subjects, under pain of death, should change to European costume. So in 1920 the astronomer gave his demonstration all over again, dressed with impressive style and elegance. And this time everybody accepted his report.\n\n\nIf I have told you these details about the asteroid, and made a note of its number for you, it is on account of the grown-ups and their ways. When you tell them that you have made a new friend, they never ask you any questions about essential matters. They never say to you, 'What does his voice sound like? What games does he love best? Does he collect butterflies?' Instead, they demand: 'How old is he? How many brothers has he? How much does he weigh? How much money does his father make?' Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him.\n\nIf you were to say to the grown-ups: 'I saw a beautiful house made of rosy brick, with geraniums in the windows and doves on the roof,' they would not be able to get any idea of that house at all. You would have to say to them: 'I saw a house that cost $20,000.' Then they would exclaim: 'Oh, what a pretty house that is!'\n\nJust so, you might say to them: 'The proof that the little prince existed is that he was charming, that he laughed, and that he was looking for a sheep. If anybody wants a sheep, that is a proof that he exists.' And what good would it do to tell them that? They would shrug their shoulders, and treat you like a child. But if you said to them: 'The planet he came from is Asteroid B-612,' then they would be convinced, and leave you in peace from their questions.\n\nThey are like that. One must not hold it against them. Children should always show great forbearance toward grown-up people.\n\nBut certainly, for us who understand life, figures are a matter of indifference. I should have liked to begin this story in the fashion of the fairy-tales. I should have like to say: 'Once upon a time there was a little prince who lived on a planet that was scarcely any bigger than himself, and who had need of a sheep . . .'\n\nTo those who understand life, that would have given a much greater air of truth to my story.\n\nFor I do not want any one to read my book carelessly. I have suffered too much grief in setting down these memories. Six years have already passed since my friend went away from me, with his sheep. If I try to describe him here, it is to make sure that I shall not forget him. To forget a friend is sad. Not every one has had a friend. And if I forget him, I may become like the grown-ups who are no longer interested in anything but figures . . .\n\nIt is for that purpose, again, that I have bought a box of paints and some pencils. It is hard to take up drawing again at my age, when I have never made any pictures except those of the boa constrictor from the outside and the boa constrictor from the inside, since I was six. I shall certainly try to make my portraits as true to life as possible. But I am not at all sure of success. One drawing goes along all right, and another has no resemblance to its subject. I make some errors, too, in the little prince's height: in one place he is too tall and in another too short. And I feel some doubts about the color of his costume. So I fumble along as best I can, now good, now bad, and I hope generally fair-to-middling.\n\nIn certain more important details I shall make mistakes, also. But that is something that will not be my fault. My friend never explained anything to me. He thought, perhaps, that I was like himself. But I, alas, do not know how to see sheep through the walls of boxes. Perhaps I am a little like the grown-ups. I have had to grow old."}]}

The information would come very slowly, as it might chance to fall from his thoughts. It was in this way that I heard, on the third day, about the catastrophe of the baobabs.\n\nThis time, once more, I had the sheep to thank for it. For the little prince asked me abruptly--as if seized by a grave doubt--'It is true, isn't it, that sheep eat little bushes?'\n\n'Yes, that is true.'\n\n'Ah! I am glad!'\n\nI did not understand why it was so important that sheep should eat little bushes. But the little prince added:\n\n'Then it follows that they also eat baobabs?'\n\nI pointed out to the little prince that baobabs were not little bushes, but, on the contrary, trees as big as castles; and that even if he took a whole herd of elephants away with him, the herd would not eat up one single baobab.\n\nThe idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince laugh.\n\n'We would have to put them one on top of the other,' he said.\n\n\nBut he made a wise comment:\n\n'Before they grow so big, the baobabs start out by being little.'\n\n'That is strictly correct,' I said. 'But why do you want the sheep to eat the little baobabs?'\n\nHe answered me at once, 'Oh, come, come!', as if he were speaking of something that was self-evident. And I was obliged to make a great mental effort to solve this problem, without any assistance.\n\nIndeed, as I learned, there were on the planet where the little prince lived--as on all planets--good plants and bad plants. In consequence, there were good seeds from good plants, and bad seeds from bad plants. But seeds are invisible. They sleep deep in the heart of the earth's darkness, until some one among them is seized with the desire to awaken. Then this little seed will stretch itself and begin--timidly at first--to push a charming little sprig inoffensively upward toward the sun. If it is only a sprout of radish or the sprig of a rose-bush, one would let it grow wherever it might wish. But when it is a bad plant, one must destroy it as soon as possible, the very first instant that one recognizes it.\n\n\nNow there were some terrible seeds on the planet that was the home of the little prince; and these were the seeds of the baobab. The soil of that planet was infested with them. A baobab is something you will never, never be able to get rid of if you attend to it too late. It spreads over the entire planet. It bores clear through it with its roots. And if the planet is too small, and the baobabs are too many, they split it in pieces . . .\n\n'It is a question of discipline,' the little prince said to me later on. 'When you've finished your own toilet in the morning, then it is time to attend to the toilet of your planet, just so, with the greatest care. You must see to it that you pull up regularly all the baobabs, at the very first moment when they can be distinguished from the rosebushes which they resemble so closely in their earliest youth. It is very tedious work,' the little prince added, 'but very easy.'\n\nAnd one day he said to me: 'You ought to make a beautiful drawing, so that the children where you live can see exactly how all this is. That would be very useful to them if they were to travel some day. Sometimes,' he added, 'there is no harm in putting off a piece of work until another day. But when it is a matter of baobabs, that always means a catastrophe. I knew a planet that was inhabited by a lazy man. He neglected three little bushes . . .'\n\nSo, as the little prince described it to me, I have made a drawing of that planet. I do not much like to take the tone of a moralist. But the danger of the baobabs is so little understood, and such considerable risks would be run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid, that for once I am breaking through my reserve. 'Children,' I say plainly, 'watch out for the baobabs!'\n\nMy friends, like myself, have been skirting this danger for a long time, without ever knowing it; and so it is for them that I have worked so hard over this drawing. The lesson which I pass on by this means is worth all the trouble it has cost me.\n\n\nPerhaps you will ask me, 'Why are there no other drawing in this book as magnificent and impressive as this drawing of the baobabs?'\n\nThe reply is simple. I have tried. But with the others I have not been successful. When I made the drawing of the baobabs I was carried beyond myself by the inspiring force of urgent necessity."}]}

He has never done anything in his life but add up figures. And all day he says over and over, just like you: 'I am busy with matters of consequence!' And that makes him swell up with pride. But he is not a man--he is a mushroom!'\n\n'A what?'\n\n'A mushroom!'\n\nThe little prince was now white with rage.\n\n'The flowers have been growing thorns for millions of years. For millions of years the sheep have been eating them just the same. And is it not a matter of consequence to try to understand why the flowers go to so much trouble to grow thorns which are never of any use to them? Is the warfare between the sheep and the flowers not important? Is this not of more consequence than a fat red-faced gentleman's sums? And if I know--I, myself--one flower which is unique in the world, which grows nowhere but on my planet, but which one little sheep can destroy in a single bite some morning, without even noticing what he is doing--Oh! You think that is not important!'\n\n\n\nHis face turned from white to red as he continued:\n\n'If some one loves a flower, of which just one single blossom grows in all the millions and millions of stars, it is enough to make him happy just to look at the stars. He can say to himself, 'Somewhere, my flower is there . . .' But if the sheep eats the flower, in one moment all his stars will be darkened . . . And you think that is not important!'\n\nHe could not say anything more. His words were choked by sobbing.\n\nThe night had fallen. I had let my tools drop from my hands. Of what moment now was my hammer, my bolt, or thirst, or death? On one star, one planet, my planet, the Earth, there was a little prince to be comforted. I took him in my arms, and rocked him. I said to him:\n\n'The flower that you love is not in danger. I will draw you a muzzle for your sheep. I will draw you a railing to put around your flower. I will--'\n\nI did not know what to say to him. I felt awkward and blundering. I did not know how I could reach him, where I could overtake him and go on hand in hand with him once more.\n\nIt is such a secret place, the land of tears.\n\n \n"}]}

On the little prince's planet the flowers had always been very simple. They had only one ring of petals; they took up no room at all; they were a trouble to nobody. One morning they would appear in the grass, and by night they would have faded peacefully away. But one day, from a seed blown from no one knew where, a new flower had come up; and the little prince had watched very closely over this small sprout which was not like any other small sprouts on his planet. It might, you see, have been a new kind of baobab.\n\n\n\nThe shrub soon stopped growing, and began to get ready to produce a flower. The little prince, who was present at the first appearance of a huge bud, felt at once that some sort of miraculous apparition must emerge from it. But the flower was not satisfied to complete the preparations for her beauty in the shelter of her green chamber. She chose her colors with the greatest care. She dressed herself slowly. She adjusted her petals one by one. She did not wish to go out into the world all rumpled, like the field poppies. It was only in the full radiance of her beauty that she wished to appear. Oh, yes! She was a coquettish creature! And her mysterious adornment lasted for days and days.\n\nThen one morning, exactly at sunrise, she suddenly showed herself.\n\n\nAnd, after working with all this painstaking precision, she yawned and said:\n\n'Ah! I am scarcely awake. I beg that you will excuse me. My petals are still all disarranged . . .'\n\nBut the little prince could not restrain his admiration:\n\n'Oh! How beautiful you are!'\n\n'Am I not?' the flower responded, sweetly. 'And I was born at the same moment as the sun . . .'\n\nThe little prince could guess easily enough that she was not any too modest--but how moving--and exciting--she was!\n\n'I think it is time for breakfast,' she added an instant later. 'If you would have the kindness to think of my needs--'\n\nAnd the little prince, completely abashed, went to look for a sprinkling-can of fresh water. So, he tended the flower.\n\n\nSo, too, she began very quickly to torment him with her vanity--which was, if the truth be known, a little difficult to deal with. One day, for instance, when she was speaking of her four thorns, she said to the little prince:\n\n'Let the tigers come with their claws!'\n\n\n\n'There are no tigers on my planet,' the little prince objected. 'And, anyway, tigers do not eat weeds.'\n\n'I am not a weed,' the flower replied, sweetly.\n\n'Please excuse me . . .'\n\n'I am not at all afraid of tigers,' she went on, 'but I have a horror of drafts. I suppose you wouldn't have a screen for me?'\n\n\n\n'A horror of drafts--that is bad luck, for a plant,' remarked the little prince, and added to himself, 'This flower is a very complex creature . . .'\n\n'At night I want you to put me under a glass globe. It is very cold where you live. In the place I came from--'\n\nBut she interrupted herself at that point. She had come in the form of a seed. She could not have known anything of any other worlds. Embarassed over having let herself be caught on the verge of such a naïve untruth, she coughed two or three times, in order to put the little prince in the wrong.\n\n'The screen?'\n\n'I was just going to look for it when you spoke to me . . .'\n\nThen she forced her cough a little more so that he should suffer from remorse just the same.\n\nSo the little prince, in spite of all the good will that was inseparable from his love, had soon come to doubt her. He had taken seriously words which were without importance, and it made him very unhappy.\n\n\n\n'I ought not to have listened to her,' he confided to me one day. 'One never ought to listen to the flowers. One should simply look at them and breathe their fragrance. Mine perfumed all my planet. But I did not know how to take pleasure in all her grace. This tale of claws, which disturbed me so much, should only have filled my heart with tenderness and pity.'\n\nAnd he continued his confidences:\n\n'The fact is that I did not know how to understand anything! I ought to have judged by deeds and not by words. She cast her fragrance and her radiance over me. I ought never to have run away from her . . . I ought to have guessed all the affection that lay behind her poor little strategems. Flowers are so inconsistent! But I was too young to know how to love her . . .'\n\n "}]}

But I am a man who is naturally interested in matters of consequence.'\n\nThe little prince was still not satisfied.\n\n'If I owned a silk scarf,' he said, 'I could put it around my neck and take it away with me. If I owned a flower, I could pluck that flower and take it away with me. But you cannot pluck the stars from heaven . . .'\n\n'No. But I can put them in the bank.'\n\n'Whatever does that mean?'\n\n'That means that I write the number of my stars on a little paper. And then I put this paper in a drawer and lock it with a key.'\n\n'And that is all?'\n\n'That is enough,' said the businessman.\n\n'It is entertaining,' thought the little prince. 'It is rather poetic. But it is of no great consequence.'\n\nOn matters of consequence, the little prince had ideas which were very different from those of the grown-ups.\n\n'I myself own a flower,' he continued his conversation with the businessman, 'which I water every day. I own three volcanoes, which I clean out every week (for I also clean out the one that is extinct; one never knows). It is of some use to my volcanoes, and it is of some use to my flower, that I own them. But you are of no use to the stars . . .'\n\nThe businessman opened his mouth, but he found nothing to say in answer. And the little prince went away.\n\n'The grown-ups are certainly altogether extraordinary,' he said simply, talking to himself as he continued on his journey.\n\n "}]}

The little prince was not able to reach any explanation of the use of a street lamp and a lamplighter, somewhere in the heavens, on a planet which had no people, and not one house. But he said to himself, nevertheless:\n\n'It may well be that this man is absurd. But he is not so absurd as the king, the conceited man, the businessman, and the tippler. For at least his work has some meaning. When he lights his street lamp, it is as if he brought one more star to life, or one flower. When he puts out his lamp, he sends the flower, or the star, to sleep. That is a beautiful occupation. And since it is beautiful, it is truly useful.'\n\n\n\nWhen he arrived on the planet he respectfully saluted the lamplighter.\n\n'Good morning. Why have you just put out your lamp?'\n\n'Those are the orders,' replied the lamplighter. 'Good morning.'\n\n'What are the orders?'\n\n'The orders are that I put out my lamp. Good evening.'\n\nAnd he lighted his lamp again.\n\n'But why have you just lighted it again?'\n\n'Those are the orders,' replied the lamplighter.\n\n'I do not understand,' said the little prince.\n\n'There is nothing to understand,' said the lamplighter. 'Orders are orders. Good morning.'\n\nAnd he put out his lamp.\n\nThen he mopped his forehead with a handkerchief decorated with red squares.\n\n'I follow a terrible profession. In the old days it was reasonable. I put the lamp out in the morning, and in the evening I lighted it again. I had the rest of the day for relaxation and the rest of the night for sleep.'\n\n'And the orders have been changed since that time?'\n\n'The orders have not been changed,' said the lamplighter. 'That is the tragedy! From year to year the planet has turned more rapidly and the orders have not been changed!'\n\n'Then what?' asked the little prince.\n\n'Then--the planet now makes a complete turn every minute, and I no longer have a single second for repose. Once every minute I have to light my lamp and put it out!'\n\n'That is very funny! A day lasts only one minute, here where you live!'\n\n'It is not funny at all!' said the lamplighter. 'While we have been talking together a month has gone by.'\n\n'A month?'\n\n'Yes, a month. Thirty minutes. Thirty days. Good evening.'\n\nAnd he lighted his lamp again.\n\nAs the little prince watched him, he felt that he loved this lamplighter who was so faithful to his orders. He remembered the sunsets which he himself had gone to seek, in other days, merely by pulling up his chair; and he wanted to help his friend.\n\n'You know,' he said, 'I can tell you a way you can rest whenever you want to. . .'\n\n'I always want to rest,' said the lamplighter.\n\nFor it is possible for a man to be faithful and lazy at the same time.\n\nThe little prince went on with his explanation:\n\n'Your planet is so small that three strides will take you all the way around it. To be always in the sunshine, you need only walk along rather slowly. When you want to rest, you will walk--and the day will last as long as you like.'\n\n'That doesn't do me much good,' said the lamplighter. 'The one thing I love in life is to sleep.'\n\n'Then you're unlucky,' said the little prince.\n\n'I am unlucky,' said the lamplighter.

Perhaps that is because he is thinking of something else besides himself.'\n\nHe breathed a sigh of regret, and said to himself, again:\n\n'That man is the only one of them all whom I could have made my friend. But his planet is indeed too small. There is no room on it for two people. . .'\n\nWhat the little prince did not dare confess was that he was sorry most of all to leave this planet, because it was blest every day with 1440 sunsets!\n\n"}]}

Then the geographer would note down two mountains in a place where there was only one.'\n\n'I know some one,' said the little prince, 'who would make a bad explorer.'\n\n'That is possible. Then, when the moral character of the explorer is shown to be good, an inquiry is ordered into his discovery.'\n\n'One goes to see it?'\n\n'No. That would be too complicated. But one requires the explorer to furnish proofs. For example, if the discovery in question is that of a large mountain, one requires that large stones be brought back from it.'\n\nThe geographer was suddenly stirred to excitement.\n\n'But you--you come from far away! You are an explorer! You shall describe your planet to me!'\n\nAnd, having opened his big register, the geographer sharpened his pencil. The recitals of explorers are put down first in pencil.

But one never knows.'\n\n'One never knows,' said the geographer.\n\n'I have also a flower.'\n\n'We do not record flowers,' said the geographer.\n\n'Why is that? The flower is the most beautiful thing on my planet!'\n\n'We do not record them,' said the geographer, 'because they are ephemeral.'\n\n'What does that mean--'ephemeral'?'\n\n'Geographies,' said the geographer, 'are the books which, of all books, are most concerned with matters of consequence. They never become old-fashioned. It is very rarely that a mountain changes its position. It is very rarely that an ocean empties itself of its waters. We write of eternal things.'\n\n'But extinct volcanoes may come to life again,' the little prince interrupted. 'What does that mean-- 'ephemeral'?'\n\n'Whether volcanoes are extinct or alive, it comes to the same thing for us,' said the geographer. 'The thing that matters to us is the mountain. It does not change.'\n\n'But what does that mean--'ephemeral'?' repeated the little prince, who never in his life had let go of a question, once he had asked it.\n\n'It means, 'which is in danger of speedy disappearance.''\n\n'Is my flower in danger of speedy disappearance?'\n\n'Certainly it is.'\n\n'My flower is ephemeral,' the little prince said to himself, 'and she has only four thorns to defend herself against the world. And I have left her on my planet, all alone!'\n\nThat was his first moment of regret.

I have always loved the desert. One sits down on a desert sand dune, sees nothing, hears nothing. Yet through the silence something throbs, and gleams . . .\n\n'What makes the desert beautiful,' said the little prince, 'is that somewhere it hides a well . . .'\n\nI was astonished by a sudden understanding of that mysterious radiation of the sands. When I was a little boy I lived in an old house, and legend told us that a treasure was buried there. To be sure, no one had ever known how to find it; perhaps no one had ever even looked for it. But it cast an enchantment over that house. My home was hiding a secret in the depths of its heart . . .\n\n'Yes,' I said to the little prince. 'The house, the stars, the desert--what gives them their beauty is something that is invisible!'\n\n'I am glad,' he said, 'that you agree with my fox.'\n\nAs the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself: 'What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible . . .'\n\nAs his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: 'What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep . . .' And I felt him to be more fragile still. I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind . . .\n\nAnd, as I walked on so, I found the well, at daybreak."}]}

And then, out of nowhere, something actually did.\n\nSomeone, for whatever peculiar reason, rang her doorbell.\n\nShe wondered for a moment if she shouldn’t get the door at all. She was, after all, already in her night clothes even though it was only nine p.m. She felt self-conscious about her over-sized ECO WORRIER T-shirt and her tartan pyjama bottoms.\n\nShe put on her slippers, to be slightly more civilised, and discovered that the person at the door was a man, and one she recognised.\n\nHe was tall and gangly and boyish, with a kind face, but his eyes were sharp and bright, like they could see through things.\n\nIt was good to see him, if a little surprising, especially as he was wearing sports gear and he looked hot and sweaty despite the cold, rainy weather. The juxtaposition between them made her feel even more slovenly than she had done five seconds earlier.\n\nBut she’d been feeling lonely. And though she’d studied enough existential philosophy to believe loneliness was a fundamental part of being a human in an essentially meaningless universe, it was good to see him.\n\n‘Ash,’ she said, smiling. ‘It’s Ash, isn’t it?’\n\n‘Yes. It is.’\n\n‘What are you doing here? It’s good to see you.’\n\nA few weeks ago she’d been sat playing her electric piano and he’d run down Bancroft Avenue and had seen her in the window here at 33A and given her a little wave. He had once – years ago – asked her out for a coffee. Maybe he was about to do that again.\n\n‘It’s good to see you too,’ he said, but his tense forehead didn’t show it.\n\nWhen she’d spoken to him in the shop, he’d always sounded breezy, but now his voice contained something heavy. He scratched his brow. Made another sound but didn’t quite manage a full word.\n\n‘You running?’ A pointless question. He was clearly out for a run. But he seemed relieved, momentarily, to have something trivial to say.\n\n‘Yeah. I’m doing the Bedford Half. It’s this Sunday.’\n\n‘Oh right. Great. I was thinking of doing a half-marathon and then I remembered I hate running.’\n\nThis had sounded funnier in her head than it did as actual words being vocalised out of her mouth. She didn’t even hate running. But still, she was perturbed to see the seriousness of his expression. The silence went beyond awkward into something else.\n\n‘You told me you had a cat,’ he said eventually.\n\n‘Yes. I have a cat.’\n\n‘I remembered his name. Voltaire. A ginger tabby?’\n\n‘Yeah. I call him Volts. He finds Voltaire a bit pretentious. It turns out he’s not massively into eighteenth-century French philosophy and literature. He’s quite down-to-earth. You know. For a cat.’\n\nAsh looked down at her slippers.\n\n‘I’m afraid I think he’s dead.’\n\n‘What?’\n\n‘He’s lying very still by the side of the road. I saw the name on the collar, I think a car might have hit him. I’m sorry, Nora.’\n\nShe was so scared of her sudden switch in emotions right then that she kept smiling, as if the smile could keep her in the world she had just been in, the one where Volts was alive and where this man she’d sold guitar songbooks to had rung her doorbell for another reason.\n\nAsh, she remembered, was a surgeon. Not a veterinary one, a general human one. If he said something was dead it was, in all probability, dead.\n\n‘I’m so sorry.’\n\nNora had a familiar sense of grief. Only the sertraline stopped her crying. ‘Oh God.’\n\nShe stepped out onto the wet cracked paving slabs of Bancroft Avenue, hardly breathing, and saw the poor ginger-furred creature lying on the rain-glossed tarmac beside the kerb. His head grazed the side of the pavement and his legs were back as if in mid-gallop, chasing some imaginary bird.\n\n‘Oh Volts. Oh no. Oh God.’\n\nShe knew she should be experiencing pity and despair for her feline friend – and she was – but she had to acknowledge something else. As she stared at Voltaire’s still and peaceful expression – that total absence of pain – there was an inescapable feeling brewing in the darkness.\n\nEnvy."}]}

She was standing on a path, some kind of colonnade. The columns were brain-grey, with specks of brilliant blue. The misty vapours cleared, like spirits wanting to be unwatched, and a shape emerged.\n\nA solid, rectangular shape.\n\nThe shape of a building. About the size of a church or a small supermarket. It had a stone facade, the same colouration as the pillars, with a large wooden central door and a roof which had aspirations of grandeur, with intricate details and a grand-looking clock on the front gable, with black-painted Roman numerals and its hands pointing to midnight.

What the hell is going on?\n\nMaybe this place would hold some answers, she thought, as she walked inside.

The books were all green. Greens of multifarious shades. Some of these volumes were a murky swamp green, some a bright and light chartreuse, some a bold emerald and others the verdant shade of summer lawns.\n\nAnd on the subject of summer lawns: despite the fact that the books looked old, the air in the library felt fresh. It had a lush, grassy, outdoors kind of smell, not the dusty scent of old tomes.\n\nThe shelves really did seem to go on for ever, straight and long towards a far-off horizon, like lines indicating one-point perspective in a school art project, broken only by the occasional corridor.\n\nShe picked a corridor at random and set off. At the next turn, she took a left and became a little lost. She searched for a way out, but there was no sign of an exit. She attempted to retrace her steps towards the entrance, but it was impossible.\n\nEventually she had to conclude she wasn’t going to find the exit.\n\n‘This is abnormal,’ she said to herself, to find comfort in the sound of her own voice. ‘Definitely abnormal.’\n\nNora stopped and stepped closer to some of the books.\n\nThere were no titles or author names adorning the spines. Aside from the difference of shade, the only other variation was size: the books were of similar height but varied in width. Some had spines two inches wide, others significantly less. One or two weren’t much more than pamphlets.\n\nShe reached to pull out one of the books, choosing a medium-sized one in a slightly drab olive colour. It looked a bit dusty and worn.\n\nBefore she had pulled it clean from the shelf, she heard a voice behind her and she jumped back.\n\n‘Be careful,’ the voice said.\n\nAnd Nora turned around to see who was there."}]}

They float around. The sequence of these lists changes all the time.’\n\n‘Right, yes, that makes sense, I suppose.’\n\nShe quickly realised they ranged from the minor and quotidian (‘I regret not doing any exercise today’) to the substantial (‘I regret not telling my father I loved him before he died’).\n\nThere were continual, background regrets, which repeated on multiple pages. ‘I regret not staying in The Labyrinths, because I let down my brother.’ ‘I regret not staying in The Labyrinths, because I let down myself.’ ‘I regret not doing more for the environment.’ ‘I regret the time I spent on social media.’ ‘I regret not going to Australia with Izzy.’ ‘I regret not having more fun when I was younger.’ ‘I regret all those arguments with Dad.’ ‘I regret not working with animals.’ ‘I regret not doing Geology at University instead of Philosophy.’ ‘I regret not learning how to be a happier person.’ ‘I regret feeling so much guilt.’ ‘I regret not sticking at Spanish.’ ‘I regret not choosing science subjects in my A-levels.’ ‘I regret not becoming a glaciologist.’ ‘I regret not getting married.’ ‘I regret not applying to do a Master’s degree in Philosophy at Cambridge.’ ‘I regret not keeping healthy.’ ‘I regret moving to London.’ ‘I regret not going to Paris to teach English.’ ‘I regret not finishing the novel I started at university.’ ‘I regret moving out of London.’ ‘I regret having a job with no prospects.’ ‘I regret not being a better sister.’ ‘I regret not having a gap year after university.’ ‘I regret disappointing my father.’ ‘I regret that I teach piano more than I play it.’ ‘I regret my financial mismanagement.’ ‘I regret not living in the countryside.’\n\nSome regrets were a little fainter than others. One regret shifted from practically invisible to bold and back again, as if it was flashing on and off, right there as she looked at it. The regret was ‘I regret not yet having children.’\n\n‘That is a regret that sometimes is and sometimes isn’t,’ explained Mrs Elm, again somehow reading her mind. ‘There are a few of those.’\n\nFrom the age of 34 onwards, in the longest chapter at the end of the book, there were a lot of Dan-specific regrets. These were quite strong and bold, and played in her head like an ongoing fortissimo chord in a Haydn concerto.\n\n‘I regret being cruel to Dan.’ ‘I regret breaking up with Dan.’ ‘I regret not living in a country pub with Dan.’\n\nAs she stared down at the pages, she thought now of the man she had so nearly married."}]}

He did, however, have a dream. And his dream was to run a pub in the countryside. A dream he wanted to share with her. With Nora.\n\nAnd she got carried away with his enthusiasm. Got engaged.

She didn’t want to replicate her parents’ marriage.\n\nStill staring blankly at The Book of Regrets, she wondered if her parents had ever been in love or if they had got married because marriage was something you did at the appropriate time with the nearest available person. A game where you grabbed the first person you could find when the music stopped.\n\nShe had never wanted to play that game.\n\nBertrand Russell wrote that ‘To fear love is to fear life, and those who fear life are already three-parts dead’. Maybe that was her problem. Maybe she was just scared of living. But Bertrand Russell had more marriages and affairs than hot dinners, so perhaps he was no one to give advice.\n\nWhen her mum died three months before the wedding Nora’s grief was immense. Though she had suggested that the date should be put back, it somehow never was, and Nora’s grief fused with depression and anxiety and the feeling that her life was out of her own control. The wedding seemed such a symptom of this chaotic feeling, that she felt tied to a train track, and the only way she could loosen the ropes and free herself was to pull out of the wedding. Though, in reality, staying in Bedford and being single, and letting Izzy down about their Australia plans, and starting work at String Theory, and getting a cat, had all felt like the opposite of freedom.\n\n‘Oh no,’ said Mrs Elm, breaking Nora’s thoughts. ‘It’s too much for you.’\n\nAnd suddenly she was back feeling all this contrition, all that pain of letting people down and letting herself down, the pain she had tried to escape less than an hour ago. The regrets began to swarm together. In fact, while staring at the open pages of the book, the pain was actually worse than it had been wandering around Bedford. The power of all the regrets simultaneously emanating from the book was becoming agony. The weight of guilt and remorse and sorrow too strong. She leaned back on her elbows, dropped the heavy book and squeezed her eyes shut. She could hardly breathe, as if invisible hands were around her neck.\n\n‘Make it stop!’\n\n‘Close it now,’ instructed Mrs Elm. ‘Close the book. Not just your eyes. Close it. You have to do it yourself.’\n\nSo Nora, feeling like she was about to pass out, sat back up and placed her hand under the front cover.

The house was made even smaller by the amount of dogs there. There were five that Nora could see, though there may have been more lurking upstairs. Nora had always imagined she liked the smell of dog, but she suddenly realised there was a limit to this fondness.\n\nSitting down on the sofa she felt something hard beneath her – a plastic ring for the dogs to gnaw on. She put it on the carpet amid the other chew toys. The toy bone. The foam yellow ball with chunks bitten out of it. A half-massacred soft toy.\n\nA Chihuahua with cataracts tried to have sex with her right leg.\n\n‘Stop that, Pedro,’ said Dylan, laughing, as he pulled the little creature away from her.\n\nAnother dog, a giant, meaty, chestnut-coloured Newfoundland, was sitting next to her on the sofa, licking Nora’s ear with a tongue the size of a slipper, meaning that Dylan had to sit on the floor.\n\n‘Do you want the sofa?’\n\n‘No. I’m fine on the floor.’\n\nNora didn’t push it.

Even her dream of being a glaciologist was part of Mrs. Elm’s vision for her future. Nora picks out a life that’s no one else’s dream, the life in which she has decided to work with animals."},  {"role" : "assistant", "content" : "Someone Else’s Dream\n\n‘Life is always an act,’ Mrs Elm said, as they watched her brother being pulled back from the water’s edge by his friends. As he then watched a girl whose name she’d long forgotten make an emergency call. ‘And you acted when it counted. You swam to that bank. You clawed yourself out. You coughed your guts out and had hypothermia but you crossed the river, against incredible odds. You found something inside you.’\n\n‘Yes. Bacteria. I was ill for weeks. I swallowed so much of that shitty water.’\n\n‘But you lived. You had hope.’\n\n‘Yeah, well, I was losing it by the day.’\n\nShe stared down, to see the grass shrink back into the stone, and looked back to catch the last sight of the water before it shimmered away and the sycamore tree dissolved into air along with her brother and his friends and her own young self.\n\nThe library looked exactly like the library again. But now the books were all back on the shelves and the lights had stopped flickering.\n\n‘I was so stupid, doing that swim, just trying to impress people. I always thought Joe was better than me. I wanted him to like me.’\n\n‘Why did you think he was better than you? Because your parents did?’\n\nNora felt angry at Mrs Elm’s directness. But maybe she had a point. ‘I always had to do what they wanted me to do in order to impress them. Joe had his issues, obviously. And I didn’t really understand those issues until I knew he was gay, but they say sibling rivalry isn’t about siblings but parents, and I always felt my parents just encouraged his dreams a bit more.’\n\n‘Like music?’\n\n‘Yeah.’\n\n‘When he and Ravi decided they wanted to be rock stars, Mum and Dad bought Joe a guitar and then an electric piano.’\n\n‘How did that go?’\n\n‘The guitar bit went well. He could play “Smoke On The Water” within a week of getting it, but he wasn’t into the piano and decided he didn’t want it cluttering up his room.’\n\n‘And that’s when you got it.’ Mrs Elm said this as a statement rather than a question. She knew. Of course she knew.\n\n‘Yeah.’\n\n‘It was moved into your room, and you welcomed it like a friend, and started learning to play it with steadfast determination. You spent your pocket money on piano-teaching guides and Mozart for Beginners and The Beatles for Piano. Because you liked it. But also because you wanted to impress your older brother.’\n\n‘I never told you all this.’\n\nA wry smile. ‘Don’t worry. I read the book.’\n\n‘Right. Course. Yeah. Got you.’\n\n‘You might need to stop worrying about other people’s approval, Nora,’ Mrs Elm said in a whisper, for added power and intimacy. ‘You don’t need a permission slip to be your—’\n\n‘Yes. I get it.’\n\nAnd she did get it.\n\nEvery life she had tried so far since entering the library had really been someone else’s dream. The married life in the pub had been Dan’s dream. The trip to Australia had been Izzy’s dream, and her regret about not going had been a guilt for her best friend more than a sorrow for herself. The dream of her becoming a swimming champion belonged to her father. And okay, so it was true that she had been interested in the Arctic and being a glaciologist when she was younger, but that had been steered quite significantly by her chats with Mrs Elm herself, back in the school library. And The Labyrinths, well, that had always been her brother’s dream.\n\nMaybe there was no perfect life for her, but somewhere, surely, there was a life worth living. And if she was to find a life truly worth living, she realised she would have to cast a wider net.\n\nMrs Elm was right. The game wasn’t over. No player should give up if there were pieces still left on the board.\n\nShe straightened her back and stood up tall.\n\n‘You need to choose more lives from the bottom or top shelves. You have been seeking to undo your most obvious regrets. The books on the higher and lower shelves are the lives a little bit further removed. Lives you are still living in one universe or another but not ones you have been imagining or mourning or thinking about. They are lives you could live but never dreamed of.’\n\n‘So they’re unhappy lives?’\n\n‘Some will be, some won’t be. It’s just they are not the most obvious lives. They are ones which might require a little imagination to reach. But I am sure you can get there . . .’\n\n‘Can’t you guide me?’\n\nMrs Elm smiled. ‘I could read you a poem. Librarians like poems.’ And then she quoted Robert Frost. ‘Two roads diverged in a wood, and I – / I took the one less travelled by, / And that has made all the difference . . .’\n\n‘What if there are more than two roads diverging in the wood? What if there are more roads than trees? What if there is no end to the choices you could make? What would Robert Frost do then?’\n\nShe remembered studying Aristotle as a first-year Philosophy student. And being a bit depressed by his idea that excellence was never an accident. That excellent outcomes were the result of ‘the wise choice of many alternatives’. And here she was, in the privileged position of being able to sample these many alternatives. It was a shortcut to wisdom and maybe a shortcut to happiness too. She saw it now not as a burden but a gift to be cherished.\n\n‘Look at that chessboard we put back in place,’ said Mrs Elm, softly. ‘Look at how ordered and safe and peaceful it looks now, before a game starts. It’s a beautiful thing. But it is boring. It is dead. And yet the moment you make a move on that board, things change. Things begin to get more chaotic. And that chaos builds with every single move you make.’\n\nShe took a seat at the chess table, opposite Mrs Elm. She stared down at the board and moved a pawn two spaces forward.\n\nMrs Elm mirrored the move on her side of the board.\n\n‘It’s an easy game to play,’ she told Nora. ‘But a hard one to master. Every move you make opens a whole new world of possibility.’\n\nNora moved one of her knights. They progressed like this for a little while.\n\nMrs Elm provided a commentary. ‘At the beginning of a game, there are no variations. There is only one way to set up a board. There are nine million variations after the first six moves. And after eight moves there are two hundred and eighty-eight billion different positions. And those possibilities keep growing. There are more possible ways to play a game of chess than the amount of atoms in the observable universe. So it gets very messy. And there is no right way to play; there are many ways. In chess, as in life, possibility is the basis of everything. Every hope, every dream, every regret, every moment of living.’\n\nEventually, Nora won the game. She had a sneaky suspicion that Mrs Elm had let her, but still she was feeling a bit better.\n\n‘Okey-dokey,’ said Mrs Elm. ‘Now, time for a book, I reckon. What do you say?’\n\nNora gazed along the bookshelves. If only they had more specific titles. If only there was one that said Perfect Life Right Here.\n\nHer initial instinct had been to ignore Mrs Elm’s question. But where there were books, there was always the temptation to open them. And she realised it was the same with lives.\n\nMrs Elm repeated something she said earlier.\n\n‘Never underestimate the big importance of small things.’\n\nThis was useful, as it turned out.\n\n‘I want,’ she said, ‘a gentle life. The life where I worked with animals. Where I chose the animal shelter job – where I did my work experience at school – over the one at String Theory. Yes. Give me that one, please.’"}]}

Dylan reminds her of a dog with his good-natured, pure demeanor."},  {"role" : "assistant", "content" : "A Gentle Life\n\nIt turned out that this particular existence was quite easy to slip into.\n\nSleep was good in this life, and she didn’t wake up until the alarm went off at a quarter to eight. She drove to work in a tatty old Hyundai that smelled of dogs and biscuits and was decorated with crumbs, passing the hospital and the sports centre, and pulling up in the small car park outside the modern, grey-bricked, single-storey rescue centre.\n\nShe spent the morning feeding and walking the dogs. The reason it was quite easy to blend into this life was at least partly because she had been greeted by an affable, down-to-earth woman with brown curly hair and a Yorkshire accent. The woman, Pauline, said Nora was to start work in the dog shelter, rather than the cat shelter, and so Nora had a legitimate excuse to ask what to do and look confused. Also, the issue of knowing people’s names was solved by the fact that all the workers had name badges.\n\nNora had walked a bullmastiff, a new arrival, around the field behind the shelter. Pauline told her that the bullmastiff had been horribly treated by its owner. She pointed out a few small round scars.\n\n‘Cigarette burns.’\n\nNora wanted to live in a world where no cruelty existed, but the only worlds she had available to her were worlds with humans in them. The bullmastiff was called Sally. She was scared of everything. Her shadow. Bushes. Other dogs. Nora’s legs. Grass. Air. Though she clearly took a liking to Nora, and even succumbed to a (very quick) tummy rub.\n\nLater, Nora helped clean out some of the little dog huts. She imagined they called them huts because it sounded better than cages, which was really a more apt name for them. There was a three-legged Alsatian called Diesel, who had been there a while apparently. When they played catch, Nora discovered his reflexes were good, his mouth catching the ball almost every time. She liked this life – or more precisely, she liked the version of herself in this life. She could tell the kind of person she was from the way people spoke to her. It felt nice – comforting, solidifying – to be a good person.\n\nHer mind felt different here. She thought a lot in this life, but her thoughts were gentle.\n\n‘Compassion is the basis of morality,’ the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer had written, in one of his softer moments. Maybe it was the basis of life too.\n\nThere was one man who worked there called Dylan, who had a natural way with all the dogs. He was about her age, maybe younger. He had a kind, gentle, sad look about him. His long surf-dude hair golden as a retriever. He came and sat next to Nora on a bench at lunch, overlooking the field.\n\n‘What are you having today?’ he asked, sweetly, nodding to Nora’s lunchbox.\n\nShe honestly didn’t know – she had found it already prepared when she’d opened her magnet- and calendar-cluttered fridge that morning. She peeled off the lid to find a cheese and Marmite sandwich and a packet of salt and vinegar crisps. The sky darkened and the wind picked up.\n\n‘Oh crap,’ Nora said. ‘It’s going to rain.’\n\n‘Maybe, but the dogs are all still in their cages.’\n\n‘Sorry?’\n\n‘Dogs can smell when rain is coming, so they often head indoors if they think it’s going to happen. Isn’t that cool? That they can predict the future with their nose?’\n\n‘Yes,’ said Nora. ‘Way cool.’\n\nNora bit into her cheese sandwich. And then Dylan put his arm around her.\n\nNora jumped up.\n\n‘—the hell?’ she said.\n\nDylan looked deeply apologetic. And a little horrified at himself. ‘I’m sorry. Did I hurt your shoulder?’\n\n‘No . . . I just . . . I . . . No. No. It’s fine.’\n\nShe discovered that Dylan was her boyfriend and that he had gone to the same secondary school as her. Hazeldene Comp. And that he was two years younger.\n\nNora could remember the day her dad died, when she was in the school library staring as a blond boy from a couple of years below ran past outside the rain-speckled window. Either chasing someone or being chased. That had been him. She had vaguely liked him, from a distance, but without really knowing him or thinking about him at all.\n\n‘You all right, Norster?’ Dylan asked.\n\nNorster?\n\n‘Yeah. I was just . . . Yeah. I’m fine.’\n\nNora sat down again but left a bit more bench between them. There was nothing overtly wrong with Dylan. He was sweet. And she was sure that in this life she genuinely liked him. Maybe even loved him. But entering a life wasn’t the same as entering an emotion.\n\n‘By the way, did you book Gino’s?’\n\nGino’s. The Italian. Nora had gone there as a teenager. She was surprised it was still going.\n\n‘What?’\n\n‘Gino’s? The pizza place? For tonight? You said you kind of know the manager there.’\n\n‘My dad used to, yeah.’\n\n‘So, did you manage to call?’\n\n‘Yes,’ she lied. ‘But actually, it is fully booked.’\n\n‘On a weeknight? Weird. That’s a shame. I love pizza. And pasta. And lasagne. And—’\n\n‘Right,’ said Nora. ‘Yes. I get it. I completely get it. I know it was strange. But they had a couple of big bookings.’\n\nDylan already had his phone out. He was eager. ‘I’ll try La Cantina. You know. The Mexican. Tons of vegan options. I love a Mexican, don’t you?’\n\nNora couldn’t think of a legitimate reason for her not to do this, aside from Dylan’s not-entirely-riveting conversation, and compared to the sandwich she was currently eating and the state of the rest of her fridge, Mexican food sounded promising.\n\nSo, Dylan booked them a table. And they carried on talking as dogs barked in the building behind them. It emerged during the conversation that they were thinking of moving in together.\n\n‘We could watch Last Chance Saloon,’ he said.\n\nShe wasn’t really listening. ‘What’s that?’\n\nHe was shy, she realised. Bad with eye contact. Quite endearing. ‘You know, that Ryan Bailey film you wanted to watch. We saw the trailer for it. You said it’s meant to be funny and I did some research and it has an eighty-six per cent on Rotten Tomatoes and it’s on Netflix so . . .’\n\nShe wondered if Dylan would believe her if she told him that in one life she was a lead singer of an internationally successful pop-rock band and global icon who had actually dated and voluntarily broken up with Ryan Bailey.\n\n‘Sounds good,’ she said, as she stared at an empty crisp packet floating across the sparse grass.\n\nDylan rushed off the bench to grab the packet and dropped it into the bin next to the bench.\n\nHe flopped back to Nora, smiling. Nora understood what this other Nora saw in him. There was something pure about him. Like a dog himself."}]}

Do you think this is a good universe? Or would you rather be in a universe where you left Bedford?’\n\n‘Not really. I am happy here. Why want another universe if this one has dogs?

He was a good person, and good people were rare.\n\nAs they reached the restaurant, they saw a tall dark-haired man in running gear jogging towards them. It took a disorientating moment for Nora to realise it was Ash – the Ash who had been a surgeon, the Ash who had been a customer at String Theory and who had asked her out for coffee, the Ash who had comforted her in the hospital and who had knocked on her door, in another world, last night, to tell her that Voltaire was dead. It seemed so recent, that memory, and yet it was hers alone. He was obviously doing some training for the half-marathon on Sunday. There was no reason to believe that the Ash in this life was any different from the one in her root life, except the chances were that he probably hadn’t found a dead Voltaire last night. Or maybe he had, though Voltaire wouldn’t have been called Voltaire.\n\n‘Hi,’ she said, forgetting which timeline she was in.\n\nAnd Ash smiled back at her, but it was a confused smile. Confused, but kind, which somehow made Nora feel even more cringey. Because of course in this life there had not been the knock on her door, there had never even been the asking for a coffee, or the purchase of a Simon & Garfunkel songbook.\n\n‘Who was that?’ Dylan asked.\n\n‘Oh, just someone I knew in another life.’\n\nDylan was confused but shook it away like rain.\n\nAnd then they were there."}]}

If anything, he looked healthier than he had done on her doorstep and, like then, he was wearing running gear – though here the clothes seemed a bit fancier and more expensive, and he had some kind of fitness tracker attached to his arm.\n\nHe was smiling and holding two cups of coffee, one of which was for Nora. She wondered how many coffees they had shared together, since the first.\n\n‘Oh, thank you.’\n\n‘Oh no, Nor, did you sleep in here all night?’ he asked.\n\nNor.\n\n‘Most of it. I meant to go back to bed but Molly was in a state. I had to calm her and then I was too tired to move.’\n\n‘Oh no. I’m so sorry. I didn’t hear her.’ He seemed genuinely sad. ‘It was probably my fault. I showed her some bears on YouTube yesterday before work.’\n\n‘No worries.’\n\n‘Anyway, I’ve walked Plato. I’m not in the hospital till midday today. It’s going to be a late one. Are you still wanting to go into the library today?’\n\n‘Oh. You know what? I might give it a miss.’\n\n‘Okay, well, I got Mol some brekkie and will drop her off at school.’\n\n‘I can take Molly,’ said Nora. ‘If you’ve got a big day.’\n\n‘Oh, it’s an okay one. A gall bladder and a pancreas so far. Easy street. Am going to get a run in.’\n\n‘Right. Yes. ’Course. For the half-marathon on Sunday.’\n\n‘What?’\n\n‘Nothing. It doesn’t matter,’ Nora said, ‘I’m just delirious from sleeping on the floor.’\n\n‘No worries. Anyway, my sister phoned. They want her to illustrate the calendar for Kew Gardens. Lots of plants. She’s really pleased.’\n\nHe smiled. He seemed happy for this sister of his who Nora had never heard of. She wanted to thank him for being so good about her dead cat, but she obviously couldn’t so she just said, ‘Thank you.’\n\n‘For what?’\n\n‘Just, you know, everything.’\n\n‘Oh. Right. Okay.’\n\n‘So, thank you.’\n\nHe nodded. ‘That’s nice. Anyway, run time.’\n\nHe drained his coffee and then disappeared. Nora scanned the room, absorbing every new piece of information. Every cuddly toy and book and plug socket, as if they were all part of the jigsaw of her life.\n\nAn hour later, Molly was being dropped off at her infant school and Nora was doing the usual. Checking her emails and social media. Her social media activity wasn’t great in this life, which was always a promising sign, but she did have a hell of a lot of emails. From these emails she divined that she was not simply ‘stopping’ teaching at the moment but had officially stopped. She was on a sabbatical in order to write a book about Henry David Thoreau and his relevance for the modern-day environmentalist movement. Later in the year she planned to visit Walden Pond in Concord, Massachusetts, funded by a research grant.\n\nThis seemed pretty good.\n\nAlmost annoyingly good.\n\nA good life with a good daughter and a good man in a good house in a good town. It was an excess of good. A life where she could sit down all day reading and researching and writing about her all-time favourite philosopher.\n\n‘This is cool,’ she told the dog. ‘Isn’t this cool?’\n\nPlato yawned indifference.\n\nThen she set about exploring her house, being watched by the Labrador from the comfy-looking sofa. The living room was vast. Her feet sunk into the soft rug.\n\nWhite floorboards, TV, wood-burner, electric piano, two new laptops on charge, a mahogany chest on which perched an ornate chess set, nicely stacked bookshelves. A lovely guitar resting in the corner. Nora recognised the model instantly as an electro-acoustic ‘Midnight Satin’ Fender Malibu. She had sold one during her last week working at String Theory.\n\nThere were photos in frames dotted around the living room. Kids she didn’t know with a woman who looked like Ash – presumably his sister. An old photo of her deceased parents on their wedding day, and one of her and Ash getting married. She could see her brother in the background. A photo of Plato. And one of a baby, presumably Molly.\n\nShe glanced at the books. Some yoga manuals, but not the second-hand ones she owned in her root life. Some medical books. She recognised her copy of Bertrand Russell’s History of Western Philosophy, along with Henry David Thoreau’s Walden, both of which she’d owned since university. A familiar Principles of Geology was also there. There were quite a few books on Thoreau. And copies of Plato’s Republic and Hannah Arendt’s The Origins of Totalitarianism, which she did own in her root life, but not in these editions. Intellectual-looking books by people like Julia Kristeva and Judith Butler and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. There were a lot of works on Eastern philosophy that she had never read before and she wondered if she stayed in this life, and she couldn’t see why not, whether there was a way to read them all before she had to do any more teaching at Cambridge.\n\nNovels, some Dickens, The Bell Jar, some geeky pop-science books, a few music books, a few parenting manuals, Nature by Ralph Waldo Emerson and Silent Spring by Rachel Carson, some stuff on climate change, and a large hardback called Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape.\n\nShe had rarely, if ever, been this consistently highbrow. This was clearly what happened when you did a Master’s degree at Cambridge and then went on sabbatical to write a book on your favourite philosopher.\n\n‘You’re impressed by me,’ she told the dog. ‘You can admit it.’\n\nThere was also a pile of music songbooks, and Nora smiled when she saw that the one on top was the Simon & Garfunkel one she had sold to Ash the day he had asked her out for a coffee. On the coffee table there was a nice glossy hardback book of photographs of Spanish scenery and on the sofa there was something called The Encyclopedia of Plants and Flowers.\n\nAnd in the magazine rack there was the brand-new National Geographic with the picture of the black hole on the cover.\n\nThere was a picture on the wall. A Miró print from a museum in Barcelona.\n\n‘Have me and Ash been to Barcelona together, Plato?’ She imagined them both, hand-in-hand, wandering the streets of the Gothic Quarter together, popping into a bar for tapas and Rioja.\n\nOn the wall opposite the bookshelves there was a mirror. A broad mirror with an ornate white frame. She no longer got surprised by the variations in appearance between lives. She had been every shape and size and had every haircut. In this life, she looked perfectly pleasant. She would have liked to be friends with this person. It wasn’t an Olympian or a rock star or a Cirque du Soleil acrobat she was looking at, but it was someone who seemed to be having a good life, as far as you could tell these things. A grown-up who had a vague idea of who she was and what she was doing in life. Short hair, but not dramatically so, skin looking healthier than in her root life, either through diet, a lack of red wine, exercise, or the cleansers and moisturisers she’d seen in the bathroom, which were all more expensive than anything she owned in her root life.\n\n‘Well,’ she said to Plato. ‘This is a nice life, yeah?’\n\nPlato seemed to agree."}]}

You’re just a . . . mechanism.’\n\n‘Aren’t we all?’\n\n‘Not like that. You are the product of some strange interaction between my mind and the multiverse, some simplification of the quantum wave function or whatever it is.’\n\nMrs Elm looked perturbed by the suggestion. ‘What is the matter?’\n\nNora thought of the polar bear as she stared down at the yellow-brown stone floor. ‘I nearly died.’\n\n‘And remember, if you die in a life, there is no way back here.’\n\n‘That’s not fair.’\n\n‘The library has strict rules.

In fact, this experience has just managed to confirm that.’\n\nShe shook her head. ‘I don’t think you think that.’\n\n‘I do think that. That’s why I said it.’\n\n‘No. The Book of Regrets is getting lighter. There’s a lot of white space in there now . . . It seems that you have spent all your life saying things that you aren’t really thinking. This is one of your barriers.’\n\n‘Barriers?’\n\n‘Yes. You have a lot of them. They stop you from seeing the truth.’\n\n‘About what?’\n\n‘About yourself. And you really need to start trying. To see the truth. Because this matters.’\n\n‘I thought there were an infinite number of lives to choose from.’\n\n‘You need to pick the life you’d be most happy inside. Or soon there won’t be a choice at all.’\n\n‘I met someone who has been doing this for a long time and he still hasn’t found a life that he is satisfied with . . .’\n\n‘Well, Hugo’s is a privilege you might not have.’\n\n‘Hugo? How do you—’\n\nBut then she remembered Mrs Elm knew a lot more than she should.\n\n‘You need to choose carefully,’ continued the librarian. ‘One day the library may not be here and you’ll be gone for ever.’\n\n‘How many lives do I have?’\n\n‘This isn’t a magic lamp and I am no genie. There is no set number. It could be one. It could be a hundred. But you only have an infinite number of lives to choose from so long as the time in the Midnight Library stays, well, at midnight. Because while it stays at midnight, your life – your root life – is somewhere between life and death. If time moves here, that means something very . . .’ She searched for a delicate word. ‘. . . decisive has happened. Something that razes the Midnight Library to the ground, and takes us with it. And so I would err on the side of caution. I would try to think very keenly about where you want to be. You have clearly made some progress, I can tell. You seem to realise that life could be worth living, if only you found the right one to exist inside. But you don’t want that gate to close before you get a chance to go through it.’\n\nThey both were silent for a very long time, as Nora observed all the books all around her. All the possibilities. Calmly and slowly, she walked along the aisle, wondering what lay beyond the covers of each book, and wishing the green spines would offer some kind of clue.\n\n‘Now, which book do you fancy?’ came Mrs Elm’s words behind her.\n\nNora remembered Hugo’s words in the kitchen.\n\nDream big.\n\nThe librarian had a penetrating gaze. ‘Who is Nora Seed? And what does she want?’\n\nWhen Nora thought of her closest access to happiness, it was music. Yes, she still played the piano and keyboard sometimes, but she had given up creating. She had given up singing. She thought of those happy early pub gigs playing ‘Beautiful Sky’. She thought of her brother larking about on stage with her and Ravi and Ella.\n\nSo now she knew precisely which book to ask for."}]}

That was the first observation. Her body was coursing with adrenaline and her clothes were clinging to her. There were people around her, a couple of whom had guitars. She could hear noise. Vast, powerful human noise – a roar of life slowly finding rhythm and shape. Becoming a chant.\n\nThere was a woman in front of her, towelling her face.\n\n‘Thanks,’ Nora said, smiling.\n\nThe woman looked startled, as if she’d just been spoken to by a god.\n\nShe recognised a man holding drumsticks. It was Ravi. His hair was dyed white-blonde and he was dressed in a sharp-cut indigo suit with a bare chest where his shirt should have been. He looked an entirely different person to the one who had been looking at the music magazines in the newsagent’s in Bedford only yesterday, or the corporate-looking guy in the blue shirt who had sat watching her do her catastrophic talk in the InterContinental Hotel.\n\n‘Ravi,’ she said, ‘you look amazing!’\n\n‘What?’\n\nHe hadn’t heard her over the noise, but now she had a different question.\n\n‘Where is Joe?’ she asked, almost as a shout.\n\nRavi looked momentarily confused, or scared, and Nora braced herself for some terrible truth. But none came.\n\n‘The usual, I reckon. Schmoozing it up with the foreign press.’\n\nNora had no idea what was going on. He seemed to be still part of the band, but also not in the band enough to be performing on stage with them. And if he wasn’t in the band, then whatever had caused him to leave the band hadn’t caused him to disappear completely. From what Ravi said, and the way he said it, Joe was still very much part of the team. Ella wasn’t there, though. On bass was a large muscly man with a shaved head and tattoos. She wanted to know more, but now was clearly not the time.\n\nRavi swept his hand through the air, gesturing towards what Nora could now see was a very large stage.\n\nShe was overwhelmed. She didn’t know what to feel.\n\n‘Encore time,’ said Ravi.\n\nNora tried to think. It had been a long time since she had performed anything. And even then it was only in front of a crowd of about twelve uninterested people in a pub basement.\n\nRavi leaned in. ‘You okay, Nora?’\n\nIt seemed a bit brittle. The way he said her name seemed to contain the same kind of resentment she’d heard when she’d bumped into him yesterday, in that very different life.\n\n‘Yes,’ she said, full shouting now. ‘Of course. It’s just . . . I have no idea what we should do for the encore.’\n\nRavi shrugged. ‘Same as always.’\n\n‘Hmm. Yeah. Right.’ Nora tried to think. She looked out at the stage. She saw a giant video screen with the words THE LABYRINTHS flashing and rotating out to the roaring crowd. Wow, she thought. We’re big. Proper, stadium-level big. She saw a keyboard and the stool she had been sitting at. Her bandmates whose names she didn’t know were about to walk back on stage.\n\n‘Where are we again?’ she asked, above the crowd noise. ‘I’ve gone blank.’\n\nThe big shaven-headed guy holding the bass told her: ‘São Paulo.’\n\n‘We’re in Brazil?’\n\nThey looked at her as if she was mad.\n\n‘Where have you been the last four days?’\n\n‘“Beautiful Sky”,’ said Nora, realising she could probably still remember most of the words. ‘Let’s do that.’\n\n‘Again?’ Ravi laughed, his face shining with sweat. ‘We did it ten minutes ago.’\n\n‘Okay. Listen,’ said Nora, her voice now a shout over the crowd demanding an encore. ‘I was thinking we do something different. Mix it up. I wondered if we could do a different song to usual.’\n\n‘We have to do “Howl”,’ said the other band member. A turquoise lead guitar strapped around her. ‘We always do “Howl”.’\n\nNora had never heard of ‘Howl’ in her life.\n\n‘Yeah, I know,’ she bluffed, ‘but let’s mix it up. Let’s do something they aren’t expecting. Let’s surprise them.’\n\n‘You’re overthinking this, Nora,’ said Ravi.\n\n‘I have no other type of thinking available.’\n\nRavi shrugged. ‘So, what should we do?’\n\nNora struggled to think. She thought of Ash – with his Simon & Garfunkel guitar songbook. ‘Let’s do “Bridge Over Troubled Water”.’\n\nRavi was incredulous. ‘What?’\n\n‘I think we should do that. It will surprise people.’\n\n‘I love that song,’ said the female bandmate. ‘And I know it.’\n\n‘Everyone knows it, Imani,’ Ravi said, dismissively.\n\n‘Exactly,’ Nora said, trying her hardest to sound like a rock star, ‘let’s do it.’"}]}

The power of fame. Like those pop icons she had seen on social media, who could say a single word and get a million likes and shares. Total fame was when you reached the point where looking like a hero, or genius, or god, required minimal effort. But the flipside was that it was precarious. It could be equally easy to fall and look like a devil or a villain, or just an arse.\n\nHer heart raced, as if she were about to set foot on a tight-rope.\n\nShe could see some of the faces in the crowd now, thousands of them, emerging from the dark. Tiny and strange, the clothed bodies almost invisible. She was staring out at twenty thousand disembodied heads.\n\nHer mouth was dry. She could hardly speak, so wondered how she was going to sing. She remembered Dan mock-wincing as she’d sung for him.\n\nThe noise of the crowd subsided.\n\nIt was time.\n\n‘Right,’ she said. ‘Here is a song you might have heard before.’\n\nThis was a stupid thing to say, she realised. They had all paid tickets for this concert presumably because they had heard a lot of these songs before.\n\n‘It’s a song that means a lot to me and my brother.’\n\nAlready the place was erupting. They screamed and roared and clapped and chanted. The response was phenomenal. She felt, momentarily, like Cleopatra. An utterly terrified Cleopatra.\n\nAdjusting her hands into position for E-flat major, she was momentarily distracted by a tattoo on her weirdly hairless forearm, written in beautifully angled calligraphic letters. It was a quote from Henry David Thoreau. All good things are wild and free. She closed her eyes and vowed not to open them until she had finished the song.\n\nShe understood why Chopin had liked playing in the dark so much. It was so much easier that way.\n\nWild, she thought to herself. Free.\n\nAs she sang, she felt alive. Even more alive than she had felt swimming in her Olympic-champion body.\n\nShe wondered why she had been so scared of this, of singing to a crowd. It was a great feeling.\n\nRavi came over to her at the end of the song, while they were still on stage. ‘That was fucking special, man,’ he shouted in her ear.\n\n‘Oh good,’ she said.\n\n‘Now let’s kill this and do “Howl”.’\n\nShe shook her head, then spoke into the microphone, hurriedly, before anyone else had a chance to. ‘Thank you for coming, everybody! I really hope you all had a nice evening. Get home safely.’\n\n‘Get home safely?’ Ravi said in the coach on the way back to the hotel. She hadn’t remembered him being such an arse. He seemed unhappy.\n\n‘What was wrong with that?’ she wondered out loud.\n\n‘Hardly your normal style.’\n\n‘Wasn’t it?’\n\n‘Well, bit of a contrast to Chicago.’\n\n‘Why? What did I do in Chicago?’\n\nRavi laughed. ‘Have you been lobotomised?’\n\nShe looked at her phone. In this life she had the latest model.\n\nA message from Izzy.\n\nIt was the same message she’d had in her life with Dan, in the pub. Not a message at all but a photo of a whale. Actually, it might have been a slightly different photo of a whale. That was interesting. Why was she still friends with Izzy in this life and not in her root life? After all, she was pretty sure she wasn’t married to Dan in this life. She checked her hand and was relieved to see a totally naked ring finger.\n\nNora supposed it was because she had already been super-famous with The Labyrinths before Izzy decided to go to Australia, so Nora’s decision not to go may have been more understandable. Or maybe Izzy just liked the idea of a famous friend.\n\nIzzy wrote something under the picture of the whale.\n\nAll good things are wild and free.\n\nShe must have known about the tattoo.\n\nAnother message came through now from her.\n\n‘Hope Brazil was a blast. Am sure you rocked it! And thanks ten million for sorting out the tix for Brisbane. Am totally stoked. As we Gold Coasters say.’\n\nThere were a few emojis of whales and hearts and thanking hands and a microphone and some musical notes.\n\nNora checked her Instagram. In this life she had 11.3 million followers.\n\nAnd bloody hell, she looked amazing. Her naturally black hair had a kind of white stripe in it. Vampiric make-up. And a lip piercing. She did look tired but she supposed that was just a result of living on tour. It was a glamorous kind of tired. Like Billie Eilish’s cool aunt.\n\nShe took a selfie and saw that while she didn’t look exactly like the excessively styled and filtered photos on her feed, which had been for magazine shoots, she did look cooler than she ever imagined she could look. As with her Australian life, she also put poems up online. The difference with this life, though, was that each poem had about half a million likes. One of the poems was even called ‘Fire’ but it was different to the other one.\n\nShe had a fire inside her.\n\nShe wondered if the fire was to warm her or destroy her.\n\nThen she realised.\n\nA fire had no motive.\n\nOnly she could have that.\n\nThe power was hers.\n\nA woman sat next to her. This woman wasn’t in the band, but she exuded importance. She was about fifty years old. Maybe she was the manager. Maybe she worked for the record company. She had the air of a strict mum about her. But she began with a smile.\n\n‘Stroke of genius,’ she said. ‘The Simon & Garfunkel thing. You’re trending across South America.’\n\n‘Cool.’\n\n‘Have posted about it from your accounts.’\n\nShe’d said this like it was a perfectly normal thing. ‘Oh. Right. Okay.’\n\n‘There’s a couple of last-minute press things tonight at the hotel. Then tomorrow it’s an early start . . . We fly to Rio first thing, then eight hours of press. All at the hotel.’\n\n‘Rio?’\n\n‘You’re up to speed with this week’s tour schedule, right?’\n\n‘Um, kind of. Could you just remind me again?’\n\nShe sighed, with good humour, as if Nora not knowing the tour schedule was totally in character. ‘Sure. Rio tomorrow. Two nights. Then the final night in Brazil – Porto Alegre – then Santiago, Chile, Buenos Aires, then Lima. And that’s the last leg of South America. Then next week it’s the start of the Asia leg – Japan, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Taiwan.’\n\n‘Peru? We’re famous in Peru?’\n\n‘Nora, you’ve been to Peru before, remember? Last year. They went out of their minds. All fifteen thousand of them. It’s at the same place. The racecourse.’\n\n‘The racecourse. Sure. Yeah. I remember. Was a good night. Really . . . good.’\n\nThat’s what this life probably felt like, she realised. One big racecourse. But she had no idea if she was the horse or the jockey in that analogy.\n\nRavi tapped the woman on the shoulder. ‘Joanna, what time’s that podcast tomorrow?’\n\n‘Oh damn. Actually, it’s tonight now. Timings. Sorry. Forgot to say. But they only really have to speak to Nora. So you can get an early night if you want.’\n\nRavi shrugged, dejected. ‘Sure. Yeah.’\n\nJoanna sighed. ‘Don’t shoot the messenger. Though it’s never stopped you before.’\n\nNora wondered again where her brother was, but the tension between Joanna and Ravi made it feel wrong to ask something she should so obviously know. So she stared out of the window as the coach drove along the four-lane highway. The glowing tail-lights of cars and lorries and motorbikes in the dark, like red and watching eyes. Distant skyscrapers with a few tiny squares of light against a humid backdrop of dark sky and darker clouds. A shadowy army of trees lined the sides and middle of the highway, splitting the traffic into two directions.\n\nIf she was still in this life tomorrow evening, she would be expected to perform an entire concert’s worth of songs, most of which she didn’t actually know. She wondered how quickly she could learn the set list.\n\nHer phone rang. A video call. The caller was ‘Ryan’.\n\nJoanna saw the name and smirked a little. ‘You’d better get that.’\n\nSo she did, even though she had no idea who this Ryan was, and the image on the screen seemed too blurry to recognise.\n\nBut then he was there. A face she had seen, in movies and imaginings, many times.\n\n‘Hey, babe. Just checking in with a friend. We’re still friends, right?’\n\nShe knew the voice too.\n\nAmerican, rugged, charming. Famous.\n\nShe heard Joanna whispering to someone else on the coach: ‘She’s on the phone to Ryan Bailey.’"}]}

They didn’t seem too bothered about the other band members but they did seem desperate to interact with Nora.\n\nShe looked at one, as she crunched over the gravel towards them. The girl had tattoos and was wearing an outfit that made her look like a flapper girl who had somehow got caught up in a cyberpunk version of a post-apocalyptic war. Her hair was styled exactly like Nora’s, complete with matching white stripe.\n\n‘Nora! Noraaaah! Hi! We love you, queen! Thank you for coming to Brazil! You rock!’ And then a chant started: ‘Nora! Nora! Nora!’\n\nWhile she was signing autographs in an illegible scribble, a man in his early twenties took off his T-shirt and asked her to sign his shoulder.\n\n‘It’s for a tattoo,’ he said.\n\n‘Really?’ she asked, writing her name onto the man’s body.\n\n‘This is the highlight of my life,’ he gushed. ‘My name is Francisco.’\n\nNora wondered how her writing on his skin with a Sharpie could be a highlight of his existence.\n\n‘You saved my life. “Beautiful Sky” saved my life. That song. It’s so powerful.’\n\n‘Oh. Oh wow. “Beautiful Sky”? You know “Beautiful Sky”?’\n\nThe fan burst into hysterics. ‘You’re so funny! This is why you are my idol! I love you so much! Do I know “Beautiful Sky”? That’s brilliant!’\n\nNora didn’t know what to say. That little song she had written when she was nineteen years old at university in Bristol had changed the life of a person in Brazil. It was overwhelming.\n\nThis, clearly, was the life she was destined for. She doubted that she would ever have to go back to the library. She could cope with being adored. It was better than being in Bedford, sitting on the number 77 bus, humming sad tunes to the window.\n\nShe posed for selfies.\n\nOne young woman looked close to tears. She had a large photo of Nora kissing Ryan Bailey.\n\n‘I was so sad when you broke up with him!’\n\n‘I know, yeah, it was sad. But, you know, things happen. It’s a . . . learning curve.’\n\nJoanna appeared at her arm and gently guided her away, towards the hotel.\n\nWhen she reached the elegant, jasmine-scented lobby (marble, chandeliers, floral displays) she saw that the rest of the band were already in the bar. But where was her brother? Maybe he’d been schmoozing the press somewhere else.\n\nAs she started to move towards the bar, she realised that everyone – concierge, receptionists, guests – was looking at her.\n\nNora was about to finally seize the opportunity to ask about her brother’s whereabouts when Joanna beckoned over a man who was wearing a T-shirt with THE LABYRINTHS printed on it in a retro sci-fi movie font. The guy was probably in his forties, with a greying beard and thinning hair, but he seemed intimidated by Nora’s presence. He did a tiny bow when he shook Nora’s hand.\n\n‘I’m Marcelo,’ he said. ‘Thanks for agreeing to the interview.’\n\nNora noticed another man behind Marcelo – younger, with piercings, tattoos and a big smile – holding recording equipment.\n\n‘We’d reserved a quiet space in the bar,’ Joanna said. ‘But there’s . . . people. I think we had better do this in Nora’s suite.’\n\n‘Great,’ said Marcelo. ‘Great, great.’\n\nAs they walked over to the lift, Nora glanced back at the bar and saw the other band members. ‘You know, maybe you’d like to speak to the others too?’ she said to Marcelo. ‘They remember things I don’t. A lot of things.’\n\nMarcelo smiled and shook his head and delicately said, ‘It works better this way, I feel . . .’\n\n‘Oh, okay,’ she said.\n\nEvery eye was on them as they waited for the lift to arrive. Joanna leaned into Nora.\n\n‘Are you okay?’\n\n‘Of course. Yeah. Why?’\n\n‘I don’t know. It’s just, you seem different tonight.’\n\n‘Different how?’\n\n‘Just . . . different.’\n\nAs they got in the lift Joanna asked another woman, one Nora recognised from the coach, to bring some drinks from the bar – two beers for the podcasters, a sparkling mineral water for Nora and a caipirinha for herself.\n\n‘And bring them up to the suite, Maya.’\n\nMaybe I am teetotal in this life, thought Nora, as she walked out of the lift and along the plush salmon-pink carpet to her suite.\n\nAnd then, as she entered it, she tried to act like this was all perfectly normal. This gigantic room, leading to another gigantic room, leading to a gigantic bathroom. There was a vast bouquet of flowers for her, with a note signed by the hotel’s manager.\n\nWow, she resisted saying, as she gazed around at the lavish furnishings, the sweeping floor-to-ceiling curtains, the pristine white bed the size of an acre, the TV the size of a small cinema, the champagne on ice, the silver tray full of ‘Brazilian honey cakes’ as the card informed them.\n\n‘Don’t suppose you’ll be having any of these,’ said Joanna, taking one of the little delicacies from the tray. ‘Now you’re on that new plan. Harley said I had to keep an eye on you.’\n\nNora watched Joanna bite into one of the cakes and wondered how good any plan could be if it didn’t involve eating something so clearly delicious as a Brazilian honey cake. She had no idea who Harley was, but she knew she didn’t like them.\n\n‘Also . . . just so you know, the fires are still going on in LA and they’re evacuating half of Calabasas now, but hopefully it won’t get as high as your place . . .’\n\nNora didn’t know whether to be pleased at the idea of having a house in LA, or worried that it was about to go on fire.\n\nThe two Brazilian podcast guys took a few moments to set up their equipment. And Nora sunk herself into the vast sofa in the living area as Joanna – attending to a few rogue crumbs around her mouth with a heavily manicured finger – explained that their music podcast, O Som, was the most popular in Brazil.\n\n‘Great demographics,’ Joanna enthused. ‘And the numbers are stratospheric. It’s totally worth doing.’\n\nAnd she stayed there, watching like a hawk mother, as the podcast began."}]}

It has been quite a ride,’ said Nora, trying to sound like a rock star.\n\n‘Now, if I may ask about the album . . . Pottersville. You wrote all the lyrics, yes?’\n\n‘Mostly, yes,’ Nora guessed, staring at the small, familiar mole on her left hand.\n\n‘She wrote all of them,’ interjected Joanna.\n\nMarcelo nodded while the other guy, still smiling toothily, fiddled about with sound levels via a laptop.\n\n‘I think “Feathers” is my favourite track,’ said Marcelo, as the drinks arrived.\n\n‘I’m glad you like it.’\n\nNora tried to think of a way she could get out of this interview. A headache? A bad stomach?\n\n‘But the one I’d like to talk about first is the first one you decided to release. “Stay Out Of My Life”. It seemed such a personal statement.’\n\nNora forced a smile. ‘The lyrics say it all really.’\n\n‘Obviously there has been some speculation about whether it refers to the . . . how do you say it in English?’\n\n‘Restraining order?’ offered Joanna, helpfully.\n\n‘Yes! The restraining order.’\n\n‘Um,’ said Nora, taken aback. ‘Well. I prefer to get it all out in the song. I find that stuff difficult to talk about.’\n\n‘Yes, I understand. It is just that in your recent Rolling Stone interview you talked a little about your former boyfriend, Dan Lord, and mentioned how difficult it was to get the . . . the . . . the restraining order against him, after he stalked you . . . Didn’t he try to break into your house? Then tell reporters that he wrote the lyrics for “Beautiful Sky”?’\n\n‘Jesus.’\n\nShe hovered at the intersection of tears and laughter, and managed, somehow, to give neither.\n\n‘I wrote it when I was still with him. But he didn’t like it. He didn’t like me being in this band. He hated it. He hated my brother. He hated Ravi. He hated Ella, who was one of the original members. Anyway, Dan was very jealous.’\n\nThis was so surreal. In one life, the life he’d supposedly wanted, Dan was so bored in his marriage to Nora he was having an affair, while in this life he was breaking into her house because he couldn’t stand her success.\n\n‘He’s a dick,’ said Nora. ‘I don’t know the Portuguese swear word for a terrible person.’\n\n‘Cabrão. It means someone’s a dick.’\n\n‘Or an asshole,’ the younger guy added, stone-faced.\n\n‘Yeah, well, he’s a cabrão. He turned out to be someone else entirely. It’s weird. The way when your life changes people act in different ways. The price of fame, I suppose.’\n\n‘And you wrote a song called “Henry David Thoreau”. You don’t get many songs named after philosophers . . .’\n\n‘I know. Well, when I studied Philosophy at university, he was my favourite. Hence my tattoo. And it made a marginally better song title than “Immanuel Kant”.’\n\nShe was getting into the swing of it now. It wasn’t too hard to act a life when it was the one she was destined for.\n\n‘And “Howl”, obviously. Such a powerful song. Number one in twenty-two countries. Grammy award-winning video with a Hollywood A-list cast. I suppose you are done talking about it?’\n\n‘I suppose, yes.’\n\nJoanna went to get herself another honey cake.\n\nMarcelo smiled, gently, as he pressed on. ‘For me it seemed so primal. The song, I mean. Like you were letting everything out. And then I discovered you wrote it on the very night you fired your last manager. Before Joanna. After you found out he’d been ripping you off . . .’\n\n‘Yeah. That wasn’t good,’ she improvised. ‘It was such a betrayal.’\n\n‘I was a big Labyrinths fan before “Howl”. But that was the one for me. That and “Lighthouse Girl”. “Howl” was where I was like, Nora Seed is a genius. The lyrics are pretty abstract, but the way you just let out that rage was so soft and soulful and powerful all at once. It’s like early Cure fused with Frank Ocean via The Carpenters and Tame Impala.’\n\nNora tried, and failed, to imagine what that could possibly sound like.\n\nHe started to sing, to everyone’s surprise: ‘“Silence the music to improve the tune / Stop the fake smiles and howl at the moon”.’\n\nNora smiled and nodded, as if she knew these lyrics. ‘Yeah. Yeah. I was just . . . howling.’\n\nMarcelo’s face became serious. He seemed genuinely concerned for her. ‘You’ve had so much shit to deal with these last few years. Stalkers, bad managers, the fake feuds, the court case, the copyright issues, the messy break-up with Ryan Bailey, the reception of the last album, rehab, that incident in Toronto . . . that time you collapsed from exhaustion in Paris, personal tragedy, drama drama drama. And all that media intrusion. Why do you think the press hate you so much?’\n\nNora began to feel a bit queasy. Was this what fame was like? Like a permanent bittersweet cocktail of worship and assault? It was no wonder so many famous people went off the rails when the rails veered in every direction. It was like being slapped and kissed at the same time.\n\n‘I . . . I don’t know . . . it’s pretty crackers . . .’\n\n‘I mean, do you ever wonder what your life would have been like if you had decided to take a different path?’\n\nNora listened to this as she stared at the bubbles rising in her mineral water.\n\n‘I think it is easy to imagine there are easier paths,’ she said, realising something for the first time. ‘But maybe there are no easy paths. There are just paths. In one life, I might be married. In another, I might be working in a shop. I might have said yes to this cute guy who asked me out for a coffee. In another I might be researching glaciers in the Arctic Circle. In another, I might be an Olympic swimming champion. Who knows? Every second of every day we are entering a new universe. And we spend so much time wishing our lives were different, comparing ourselves to other people and to other versions of ourselves, when really most lives contain degrees of good and degrees of bad.’\n\nMarcelo and Joanna and the other Brazilian guy were staring at her wide-eyed, but she was on a roll now. Freewheeling.\n\n‘There are patterns to life . . . Rhythms. It is so easy, while trapped in just the one life, to imagine that times of sadness or tragedy or failure or fear are a result of that particular existence. That it is a by-product of living a certain way, rather than simply living. I mean, it would have made things a lot easier if we understood there was no way of living that can immunise you against sadness. And that sadness is intrinsically part of the fabric of happiness. You can’t have one without the other. Of course, they come in different degrees and quantities. But there is no life where you can be in a state of sheer happiness for ever. And imagining there is just breeds more unhappiness in the life you’re in.’\n\n‘That is a great answer,’ Marcelo said, after he was sure she was finished. ‘But tonight I would say, at the concert, you seemed happy. When you played “Bridge Over Troubled Water” instead of “Howl”, that was such a powerful statement. It was saying: I am strong. It felt like you were telling us, your fans, that you were okay. And so, how is touring going?’\n\n‘Well, it’s great. And yes, I just thought I’d send a message that, you know, I am out here living my best life. But I miss home after a while.’\n\n‘Which one?’ asked Marcelo, with a quietly cheeky smile. ‘I mean, do you feel more at home in London, or LA, or on the Amalfi Coast?’\n\nIt seemed this was the life where her carbon footprint was the highest.\n\n‘I don’t know. I suppose I would say London.’\n\nMarcelo took a sharp intake of breath, as if the next question was something he had to swim under. He scratched his beard. ‘Okay, but I suppose it must be hard for you, as I know you shared that flat with your brother?’\n\n‘Why would it be hard?’\n\nJoanna gave her a curious glance from above her cocktail.\n\nMarcelo looked at her with sentimental fondness. His eyes seemed glazed. ‘I mean,’ he went on, after a delicate sip of beer, ‘your brother was such a big part of your life, such a big part of the band . . .’\n\nWas.\n\nSo much dread in such a small word. Like a stone falling through water.\n\nShe remembered asking Ravi about her brother before the encore. She remembered the crowd’s reaction when she had mentioned her brother on stage.\n\n‘He’s still around. He was here tonight.’\n\n‘She means she feels him,’ said Joanna. ‘They all feel him. He was such a strong spirit. Troubled, but strong . . . It was a tragedy how the drink and drugs and the whole life got to him in the end . . .’\n\n‘What are you talking about?’ Nora asked. She was no longer acting a life. She genuinely needed to know.\n\nMarcelo looked sad for her. ‘You know, it’s only been two years since his death . . . his overdose . . .’\n\nNora gasped.\n\nShe didn’t arrive back in the library instantly because she hadn’t absorbed it. She stood up, dazed, and staggered out of the suite.\n\n‘Nora?’ laughed Joanna, nervously. ‘Nora?’\n\nShe got in the lift and went down to the bar. To Ravi.\n\n‘You said Joe was schmoozing the media.’\n\n‘What?’\n\n‘You said. I asked you what Joe was doing and you said, “schmoozing the media”.’\n\nHe put his beer down and stared at her like a riddle. ‘And I was right. She was schmoozing the media.’\n\n‘She?’\n\nHe pointed over to Joanna, who was looking aghast as she headed over from the lifts in the lobby.\n\n‘Yeah. Jo. She was with the press.’\n\nAnd Nora felt the sadness like a punch.\n\n‘Oh no,’ she said. ‘Oh Joe . . . oh Joe . . . oh . . .’\n\nAnd the grand hotel bar disappeared. The table, the drinks, Joanna, Marcelo, the sound guy, the hotel guests, Ravi, the others, the marble floor, the barman, the waiters, the chandeliers, the flowers, all became nothing at all."}]}

It is still a library. If you are in a cathedral, you are quiet because you are in a cathedral, not because other people are there.

In one life, my brother is dead.’\n\nThe librarian’s face became stern again. ‘And in one life – one of his lives – you are dead. Will that be painful for him?’\n\n‘I doubt it. He doesn’t want anything to do with me these days. He has his own life and he blames me that it is unfulfilled.’\n\n‘So, this is all about your brother?’\n\n‘No. It’s about everything. It seems impossible to live without hurting people.’\n\n‘That’s because it is.’\n\n‘So why live at all?’\n\n‘Well, in fairness, dying hurts people too. Now, what life do you want to choose next?’\n\n‘I don’t.’\n\n‘What?’\n\n‘I don’t want another book. I don’t want another life.’\n\nMrs Elm’s face went pale, like it had done all those years ago when she’d got the call about Nora’s dad.\n\nNora felt a trembling beneath her feet. A minor earthquake. She and Mrs Elm held onto the shelves as books fell to the floor. The lights flickered and then went dark completely. The chessboard and table tipped over.\n\n‘Oh no,’ said Mrs Elm. ‘Not again.’\n\n‘What’s the matter?’\n\n‘You know what the matter is. This whole place exists because of you. You are the power source. When there is a severe disruption in that power source the library is in jeopardy. It’s you, Nora. You are giving up at the worst possible moment. You can’t give up, Nora. You have more to offer. More opportunities to have. There are so many versions of you out there. Remember how you felt after the polar bear. Remember how much you wanted life.’\n\nThe polar bear.\n\nThe polar bear.\n\n‘Even these bad experiences are serving a purpose, don’t you see?’\n\nShe saw. The regrets she had been living with most of her life were wasted ones.\n\n‘Yes.’\n\nThe minor earthquake subsided.\n\nBut there were books scattered everywhere, all over the floor.\n\nThe lights had come back on, but still flickered.\n\n‘I’m sorry,’ said Nora. She started trying to pick up the books and put them back in place.\n\n‘No,’ snapped Mrs Elm. ‘Don’t touch them. Put them down.’\n\n‘Sorry.’\n\n‘And stop saying sorry. Now, you can help me with this. This is safer.’\n\nShe helped Mrs Elm pick up the chess pieces and set up the board for a new game, putting the table back in place too.\n\n‘What about all the books on the floor? Are we just going to leave them?’\n\n‘Why do you care? I thought you wanted them to disappear completely?’\n\nMrs Elm may well have just been a mechanism that existed in order to simplify the intricate complexity of the quantum universe, but right now – sitting down between the half-empty bookshelves near her chessboard, set up for a new game – she looked sad and wise and infinitely human.\n\n‘I didn’t mean to be so harsh,’ Mrs Elm managed, eventually.\n\n‘That’s okay.’\n\n‘I remember when we started playing chess in the school library, you used to lose your best players straight away,’ she said. ‘You’d go and get the queen or the rooks right out there, and they’d be gone. And then you would act like the game was lost because you were just left with pawns and a knight or two.’\n\n‘Why are you mentioning this now?’\n\nMrs Elm saw a loose thread on her cardigan and tucked it inside her sleeve, then decided against it and let it loose again.\n\n‘You need to realise something if you are ever to succeed at chess,’ she said, as if Nora had nothing bigger to think about. ‘And the thing you need to realise is this: the game is never over until it is over. It isn’t over if there is a single pawn still on the board. If one side is down to a pawn and a king, and the other side has every player, there is still a game. And even if you were a pawn – maybe we all are – then you should remember that a pawn is the most magical piece of all. It might look small and ordinary but it isn’t. Because a pawn is never just a pawn. A pawn is a queen-in-waiting. All you need to do is find a way to keep moving forward. One square after another. And you can get to the other side and unlock all kinds of power.’\n\nNora stared at the books around her. ‘So, are you saying I only have pawns to play with?’\n\n‘I am saying that the thing that looks the most ordinary might end up being the thing that leads you to victory. You have to keep going. Like that day in the river. Do you remember?’\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nHow old had she been? Must have been seventeen, as she was no longer swimming in competitions. It was a fraught period in which her dad was cross with her all the time and her mum was going through one of her near-mute depression patches. Her brother was back from art college for the weekend with Ravi. Showing his friend the sights of glorious Bedford. Joe had arranged an impromptu party by the river, with music and beer and a ton of weed and girls who were frustrated Joe wasn’t interested in them. Nora had been invited and drank too much and somehow got talking to Ravi about swimming.\n\n‘So, could you swim the river?’ he asked her.\n\n‘Sure.’\n\n‘No you couldn’t,’ someone else had said.\n\nAnd so, in a moment of idiocy, she had decided to prove them wrong. And by the time her stoned and heavily inebriated older brother realised what she was doing, it was too late. The swim was well under way.\n\nAs she remembered this, the corridor at the end of the aisle in the library turned from stone to flowing water. And even as the shelves around her stayed where they were, the tiles beneath her feet now sprouted grass and the ceiling above her became sky. But unlike when she disappeared into another version of the present, Mrs Elm and the books remained. She was half in the library and half inside the memory.\n\nShe was staring at someone in the corridor-river. It was her younger self in the water, as the last of the summer light dissolved towards dark."}]}

The electric piano stood by the wall, silent.\n\n‘Voltsy?’\n\nThere was her yucca plant and her three tiny potted cacti, there were her bookshelves, with exactly the same mix of philosophy books and novels and untried yoga manuals and rock star biographies and pop science books. An old National Geographic with a shark on the cover and a five-month-old copy of Elle magazine, which she’d bought mainly for the Ryan Bailey interview. No new additions in a long time.\n\nThere was a bowl still full of cat food.\n\nShe looked everywhere, calling his name. It was only when she went back into her bedroom and looked under the bed that she saw him.\n\n‘Volts!’\n\nThe cat wasn’t moving.\n\nAs her arms weren’t long enough to reach him, she moved the bed.\n\n‘Voltsy. Come on, Voltsy,’ she whispered.\n\nBut the moment she touched his cold body she knew, and she was flooded with sadness and confusion. She immediately found herself back in the Midnight Library, facing Mrs Elm, who was sat this time in a comfy chair, deeply absorbed in one of the books.\n\n‘I don’t understand,’ Nora told her.\n\nMrs Elm kept her eyes on the page she was reading. ‘There will be many things you don’t understand.’\n\n‘I asked for the life in which Voltaire was still alive.’\n\n‘Actually, you didn’t.’\n\n‘What?’\n\nShe put her book down. ‘You asked for the life where you kept him indoors. That is an entirely different thing.’\n\n‘Is it?’\n\n‘Yes. Entirely. You see, if you’d have asked for the life where he was still alive I would have had to say no.’\n\n‘But why?’\n\n‘Because it doesn’t exist.’\n\n‘I thought every life exists.’\n\n‘Every possible life. You see, it turns out that Voltaire had a serious case of’ – she read carefully from the book – ‘restrictive cardiomyopathy, a severe case of it, which he was born with, and which was destined to cause his heart to go at a young age.’\n\n‘But he was hit by a car.’\n\n‘There is a difference, Nora, between dying in a road and being hit by a car. In your root life Voltaire lived longer than almost any other life, except the one you’ve just encountered, where he died only three hours ago. Although he had a tough few early years, the year you had him was the best of his life. Voltaire has had much worse lives, believe me.’\n\n‘You didn’t even know his name a moment ago. Now you know he had restrictive cardio-whatever?’\n\n‘I knew his name. And it wasn’t a moment ago. It was the same moment, check your watch.’\n\n‘Why did you lie?’\n\n‘I wasn’t lying. I asked you what your cat’s name was. I never said I didn’t know what your cat’s name was. Do you understand the difference? I just wanted you to say his name, so that you would feel something.’\n\nNora was hot with agitation now. ‘That’s even worse! You sent me into that life knowing Volts would be dead. And Volts was dead. So, nothing changed.’\n\nMrs Elm’s eyes twinkled again. ‘Except you.’\n\n‘What do you mean?’\n\n‘Well, you don’t see yourself as a bad cat owner any more. You looked after him as well as he could have been looked after. He loved you as much as you loved him, and maybe he didn’t want you to see him die. You see, cats know. They understand when their time is up. He went outside because he was going to die, and he knew it.’\n\nNora tried to take this in. Now she thought about it, there hadn’t been any external signs of damage on her cat’s body. She had just jumped to the same conclusion that Ash had jumped to. That a dead cat on the road was probably dead because of the road. And if a surgeon could think that, a mere layperson would think that too. Two plus two equals car accident.\n\n‘Poor Volts,’ Nora muttered, mournfully.\n\nMrs Elm smiled, like a teacher who saw a lesson being understood.\n\n‘He loved you, Nora. You looked after him as well as anyone could. Go and look at the last page of The Book of Regrets.’\n\nNora could see that the book was lying on the floor. She knelt on the floor beside it.\n\n‘I don’t want to open it again.’\n\n‘Don’t worry. It will be safer this time. Just stick to the last page.’\n\nOnce she had flicked to the last page, she saw one of her very last regrets – ‘I was bad at looking after Voltaire’ – slowly disappear from the page. The letters fading like retreating strangers in a fog.\n\nNora closed the book before she could feel anything bad happen.\n\n‘So, you see? Sometimes regrets aren’t based on fact at all. Sometimes regrets are just . . .’ She searched for the appropriate term and found it. ‘A load of bullshit.’\n\nNora tried to think back to her schooldays, to remember if Mrs Elm had said the word ‘bullshit’ before, and she was pretty sure she hadn’t.\n\n‘But I still don’t get why you let me go into that life if you knew Volts was going to be dead anyway? You could have told me. You could have just told me I wasn’t a bad cat owner. Why didn’t you?’\n\n‘Because, Nora, sometimes the only way to learn is to live.’\n\n‘Sounds hard.’\n\n‘Take a seat,’ Mrs Elm told her. ‘A proper seat. It’s not right, you kneeling on the floor.’ And Nora turned to see a chair behind her that she hadn’t noticed before. An antique chair – mahogany and buttoned leather, Edwardian maybe – with a brass bookstand attached to one arm. ‘Give yourself a moment.’\n\nNora sat down.\n\nShe stared at her watch. No matter how much of a moment she gave herself it stayed being midnight.\n\n‘I still don’t like this. One life of sadness was enough. What is the point of risking more?’\n\n‘Fine.’ Mrs Elm shrugged.\n\n‘What?’\n\n‘Let’s do nothing then. You can just stay here in the library with all those lives waiting on the shelves and not choose one.’\n\nNora sensed Mrs Elm was playing some kind of a game. But she went along with it.\n\n‘Fine.’\n\nSo Nora just stood there while Mrs Elm picked up her book again.\n\nIt seemed unfair to Nora that Mrs Elm could read the lives without falling into them.\n\nTime went by.\n\nAlthough technically, of course, it didn’t.\n\nNora could have stayed there for ever without getting hungry or thirsty or tired. But she could, it seemed, get bored.\n\nAs time stood still, Nora’s curiosity about the lives around her slowly grew. It turned out to be near impossible to stand in a library and not want to pull things from the shelves.\n\n‘Why can’t you just give me a life you know is a good one?’ she said suddenly.\n\n‘That is not how this library works.’\n\nNora had another question.\n\n‘Surely in most lives I will be asleep now, won’t I?’\n\n‘In many, yes.’\n\n‘So, what happens then?’\n\n‘You sleep. And then you wake up in that life. It’s nothing to worry about. But if you are nervous, you could try a life where it’s another time.’\n\n‘What do you mean?’\n\n‘Well, it’s not night-time everywhere, is it?’\n\n‘What?’\n\n‘There are an infinite number of possible universes in which you live. Are you really saying they all exist on Greenwich Mean Time?’\n\n‘Of course not,’ said Nora. She realised she was about to cave in and choose another life. She thought of the humpback whales. She thought of the unanswered message. ‘I wish I had gone to Australia with Izzy. I would like to experience that life.’\n\n‘Very good choice.’\n\n‘What? It’s a very good life?’\n\n‘Oh, I didn’t say that. I merely feel that you might be getting better at choosing.’\n\n‘So, it’s a bad life?’\n\n‘I didn’t say that either.’\n\nAnd the shelves sped into motion again, then stopped a few seconds afterwards.\n\n‘Ah, yes, there it is,’ said Mrs Elm, taking a book from the second-to-bottom shelf. She recognised it instantly, which was odd, seeing that it looked almost identical to the others around it.\n\nShe handed it to Nora, affectionately, as if it was a birthday gift.\n\n‘There you go. You know what to do.’\n\nNora hesitated.\n\n‘What if I am dead?’\n\n‘Sorry?’\n\n‘I mean, in another life. There must be other lives in which I died before today.’\n\nMrs Elm looked intrigued. ‘Isn’t that what you wanted?’\n\n‘Well, yes, but—’\n\n‘You have died an infinite number of times before today, yes. Car accident, drug overdose, drowning, a bout of fatal food poisoning, choking on an apple, choking on a cookie, choking on a vegan hot dog, choking on a non-vegan hot dog, every illness it was possible for you to catch or contract . . . You have died in every way you can, at any time you could.’\n\n‘So, I could open a book and just die?’\n\n‘No. Not instantaneously. As with Voltaire, the only lives available here are, well, lives. I mean, you could die in that life, but you won’t have died before you enter the life because this Midnight Library is not one of ghosts. It is not a library of corpses. It is a library of possibility. And death is the opposite of possibility. Understand?’\n\n‘I think so.’\n\nAnd Nora stared at the book she had been handed. Conifer green. Smooth-textured, again embossed with that broad and frustratingly meaningless title My Life.\n\nShe opened it and saw a blank page, so she moved to the next page and wondered what was going to happen this time. ‘The swimming pool was a little busier than normal . . .’\n\nAnd then she was there."}]}

Though she looked identical to the Mrs Elm Nora had always known, her manner was definitely a little more brusque. It was Mrs Elm but also somehow not Mrs Elm. It was quite confusing.\n\n‘Well what?’ Nora said, still gasping, still relieved she could no longer feel the intensity of all her regrets simultaneously.\n\n‘Which regret stands out? Which decision would you like to undo? Which life would you like to try on?’\n\nShe said that, precisely. Try on. As if this was a clothes shop and Nora could choose a life as easily as a T-shirt. It felt like a cruel game.\n\n‘That was agony. I felt like I was about to be strangled. What is the point of this?’\n\nAs Nora looked up, she noticed the lights for the first time. Just naked bulbs hanging down from wires attached to the ceiling, which seemed like a normal kind of light-grey ceiling. Except it was a ceiling that reached no walls. Like the floor here, it went on for ever.\n\n‘The point is there is a strong possibility that your old life is over. You wanted to die and maybe you will. And you will need somewhere to go to. Somewhere to land. Another life. So, you need to think hard. This library is called the Midnight Library, because every new life on offer here begins now. And now is midnight. It begins now. All these futures. That’s what is here. That’s what your books represent. Every other immediate present and ongoing future you could have had.’\n\n‘So there are no pasts in there?’\n\n‘No. Just the consequence of them. But those books are also written. And I know them all. But they are not for you to read.’\n\n‘And when does each life end?’\n\n‘It could be seconds. Or hours. Or it could be days. Months. More. If you have found a life you truly want to live, then you get to live it until you die of old age. If you really want to live a life hard enough, you don’t have to worry. You will stay there as if you have always been there. Because in one universe you have always been there. The book will never be returned, so to speak. It becomes less of a loan and more of a gift. The moment you decide you want that life, really want it, then everything that exists in your head now, including this Midnight Library, will eventually be a memory so vague and intangible it will hardly be there at all.’\n\nOne of the lights flickered overhead.\n\n‘The only danger,’ continued Mrs Elm, more ominously, ‘is when you’re here. Between lives. If you lose the will to carry on, it will affect your root life – your original life. And that could lead to the destruction of this place. You’d be gone for ever. You’d be dead. And so would your access to all this.’\n\n‘That’s what I want. I want to be dead. I would be dead because I want to be. That’s why I took the overdose. I want to die.’\n\n‘Well, maybe. Or maybe not. After all, you’re still here.’\n\nNora tried to get her head around this. ‘So, how do I return to the library? If I’m stuck in a life even worse than the one I’ve just left?’\n\n‘It can be subtle, but as soon as disappointment is felt in full, you’ll come back here. Sometimes the feeling creeps up, other times it comes all at once. If it never arrives, you’ll stay put, and you will be happy there, by definition. It couldn’t be simpler. So: pick something you would have done differently, and I will find you the book. That is to say, the life.’\n\nNora stared down at The Book of Regrets lying closed on the yellow-brown floor tiles.\n\nShe remembered chatting late at night with Dan about his dream of owning a quaint little pub in the country. His enthusiasm had been infectious, and it had almost become her dream too. ‘I wish I hadn’t left Dan. And that I was still in a relationship with him. I regret us not staying together and working towards that dream. Is there a life where we are still together?’\n\n‘Of course,’ said Mrs Elm.\n\nThe books in the library began to move again, as though the shelves were conveyor belts. This time, though, instead of going as slow as a wedding march they moved faster and faster and faster, until they couldn’t really be seen as individual books at all. They just whirred by in streams of green.\n\nThen, just as suddenly, they stopped.\n\nMrs Elm crouched down and took a book from the lowest shelf to her left. The book was one of the darker shades of green. She handed it to Nora. It was a lot lighter than The Book of Regrets, even though it was a similar size. Again, there was no title on the spine but a small one embossed on the front, precisely the same shade as the rest of the book.\n\nIt said: My Life.\n\n‘But it’s not my life . . .’\n\n‘Oh Nora, they are all your lives.’\n\n‘What do I do now?’\n\n‘You open the book and turn to the first page.’\n\nNora did so.\n\n‘O-kay,’ said Mrs Elm, with careful precision. ‘Now, read the first line.’\n\nNora stared down and read.\n\nShe walked out of the pub into the cool night air . . .\n\nAnd Nora had just enough time to think to herself, ‘Pub?’ After that, it was happening. The text began to swirl and soon became indecipherable, in fast motion, as she felt herself weaken. She never knowingly let go of the book, but there was a moment where she was no longer a person reading it, and a consequent moment where there was no book – or library – at all."}]}

"},  {"role" : "assistant", "content" : "The Tree That Is Our Life\n\nFive minutes later Nora was back in the hotel’s vast conference room. At least a thousand people were watching the first speaker conclude her presentation. The author of Zero to Hero. The book Dan had beside his bed in another life. But Nora wasn’t really listening, as she sat in her reserved seat in the front row. She was too upset about her mother, too nervous about the speech, so she just picked up the odd word or phrase that floated into her mind like croutons in minestrone. ‘Little-known fact’, ‘ambition’, ‘what you may be surprised to hear is that’, ‘if I can do it’, ‘hard knocks’.\n\nIt was hard to breathe in this room. It smelled of musky perfume and new carpet.\n\nShe tried to stay calm.\n\nLeaning into her brother, she whispered, ‘I don’t think I can do this.’\n\n‘What?’\n\n‘I think I’m having a panic attack.’\n\nHe looked at her, smiling, but with a toughness in his eyes she remembered from a different life, when she’d had a panic attack before one of their early gigs with The Labyrinths at a pub in Bedford. ‘You’ll be fine.’\n\n‘I don’t know if I can do this. I’ve gone blank.’\n\n‘You’re overthinking it.’\n\n‘I have anxiety. I have no other type of thinking available.’\n\n‘Come on. Don’t let us down.’\n\nDon’t let us down.\n\n‘But—’\n\nShe tried to think of music.\n\nThinking of music had always calmed her down.\n\nA tune came to her. She was slightly embarrassed, even within herself, to realise the song in her head was ‘Beautiful Sky’. A happy, hopeful song that she hadn’t sung in a long time. The sky grows dark / The black over blue / Yet the stars still dare / To shine for—\n\nBut then the person Nora was sitting next to – a smartly dressed business woman in her fifties, and the source of the musky perfume smell – leaned in and whispered, ‘I’m so sorry about what happened to you. You know, the stuff in Portugal . . .’\n\n‘What stuff?’\n\nThe woman’s reply was drowned out as the audience erupted into applause at that moment.\n\n‘What?’ she asked again.\n\nBut it was too late. Nora was being beckoned towards the stage and her brother was elbowing her.\n\nHer brother’s voice, bellowing almost: ‘They want you. Off you go.’\n\nShe headed tentatively towards the lectern on the stage, towards her own huge face smiling out triumphantly, golden medal around her neck, projected on the screen behind her.\n\nShe had always hated being watched.\n\n‘Hello,’ she said nervously, into the microphone. ‘It is very nice to be here today . . .’\n\nA thousand or so faces stared, waiting.\n\nShe had never spoken to so many people simultaneously. Even when she had been in The Labyrinths, they had never played a gig for more than a hundred people, and back then she kept the talking between the songs as minimal as possible. Working at String Theory, although she was perfectly okay talking with customers, she rarely spoke up in staff meetings, even though there had never been more than five people in the room. Back at university, while Izzy always breezed through presentations Nora would worry about them for weeks in advance.\n\nJoe and Rory were staring at her with baffled expressions.\n\nThe Nora she had seen in the TED talk was not this Nora, and she doubted she could ever become that person. Not without having done all that she had done.\n\n‘Hello. My name is Nora Seed.’\n\nShe hadn’t meant it to be funny but the whole room laughed at this. There had clearly been no need to introduce herself.\n\n‘Life is strange,’ she said. ‘How we live it all at once. In a straight line. But really that’s not the whole picture. Because life isn’t simply made of the things we do, but the things we don’t do too. And every moment of our life is a . . . kind of turning.’\n\nStill nothing.\n\n‘Think about it. Think about how we start off . . . as this set thing. Like the seed of a tree planted in the ground. And then we . . . we grow . . . we grow . . . and at first we are a trunk . . .’\n\nAbsolutely nothing.\n\n‘But then the tree – the tree that is our life – develops branches. And think of all those branches, departing from the trunk at different heights. And think of all those branches, branching off again, heading in often opposing directions. Think of those branches becoming other branches, and those becoming twigs. And think of the end of each of those twigs, all in different places, having started from the same one. A life is like that, but on a bigger scale. New branches are formed every second of every day. And from our perspective – from everyone’s perspective – it feels like a . . . like a continuum. Each twig has travelled only one journey. But there are still other twigs. And there are also other todays. Other lives that would have been different if you’d taken different directions earlier in your life. This is a tree of life. Lots of religions and mythologies have talked about the tree of life. It’s there in Buddhism, Judaism and Christianity. Lots of philosophers and writers have talked about tree metaphors too. For Sylvia Plath, existence was a fig tree and each possible life she could live – the happily-married one, the successful-poet one – was this sweet juicy fig, but she couldn’t get to taste the sweet juicy figs and so they just rotted right in front of her. It can drive you insane, thinking of all the other lives we don’t live.\n\n‘For instance, in most of my lives I am not standing at this podium talking to you about success . . . In most lives I am not an Olympic gold medallist.’ She remembered something Mrs Elm had told her in the Midnight Library. ‘You see, doing one thing differently is very often the same as doing everything differently. Actions can’t be reversed within a lifetime, however much we try . . .’\n\nPeople were listening now. They clearly needed a Mrs Elm in their lives.\n\n‘The only way to learn is to live.’\n\nAnd she went on in this manner for another twenty minutes, remembering as much as possible of what Mrs Elm had told her, and then she looked down at her hands, glowing white from the light of the lectern.\n\nAs she absorbed the sight of a raised, thin pink line of flesh, she knew the scar was self-inflicted, and it put her off her flow. Or rather, put her into a new one.\n\n‘And . . . and the thing is . . . the thing is . . . what we consider to be the most successful route for us to take, actually isn’t. Because too often our view of success is about some external bullshit idea of achievement – an Olympic medal, the ideal husband, a good salary. And we have all these metrics that we try and reach. When really success isn’t something you measure, and life isn’t a race you can win. It’s all . . . bollocks, actually . . .’\n\nThe audience definitely looked uncomfortable now. Clearly this was not the speech they were expecting. She scanned the crowd and saw a single face smiling up at her. It took a second, given the fact that he was smartly dressed in a blue cotton shirt and with hair far shorter than it was in his Bedford life, for her to realise it was Ravi. This Ravi looked friendly, but she couldn’t shake the knowledge of the other Ravi, the one who had stormed out of the newsagent’s, sulking about not being able to afford a magazine and blaming her for it.\n\n‘You see, I know that you were expecting my TED talk on the path to success. But the truth is that success is a delusion. It’s all a delusion. I mean, yes, there are things we can overcome. For instance, I am someone who gets stage fright and yet, here I am, on a stage. Look at me . . . on a stage! And someone told me recently, they told me that my problem isn’t actually stage fright. My problem is life fright. And you know what? They’re fucking right. Because life is frightening, and it is frightening for a reason, and the reason is that it doesn’t matter which branch of a life we get to live, we are always the same rotten tree. I wanted to be many things in my life. All kinds of things. But if your life is rotten, it will be rotten no matter what you do. The damp rots the whole useless thing . . .’\n\nJoe was desperately slicing his hand in the air around his neck, making a ‘cut it’ gesture.\n\n‘Anyway, just be kind and . . . Just be kind. I have a feeling I am about to go, so I would just like to say I love my brother Joe. I love you, brother, and I love everyone in this room, and it was very nice to be here.’\n\nAnd the moment she had said it was nice to be there, was also the moment she wasn’t there at all."}]}

This was the loosely defined office area she had glimpsed earlier, in one of the broader corridors. The desk was covered with administrative trays barely containing scattered piles of papers and boxes, and the computer.\n\nThe computer was a really old-fashioned-looking, cream-coloured boxy one on the desk by the papers. The kind that Mrs Elm would once have had in her school library. She was at the keyboard now, typing with urgency, staring at the monitor as Nora stood behind her.\n\nThe lights above – the same bare light bulbs hanging down from wires – were flickering wildly.\n\n‘My dad was alive because of me. But he’d also had an affair, and my mum died earlier, and I got on with my brother because I had never let him down, but he was still the same brother, really, and he was only really okay with me in that life because I was helping him make money and . . . and . . . it wasn’t the Olympic dream I imagined.

Are there any other lives at all or is it just the furnishings that change?’\n\nBut Mrs Elm wasn’t listening. Nora noticed something on the desk. An old plastic orange fountain pen. The exact same kind that Nora had once owned at school.\n\n‘Hello? Mrs Elm, can you hear me?’\n\nSomething was wrong.\n\nThe librarian’s face was tight with worry. She read from the screen, to herself. ‘System error.’\n\n‘Mrs Elm? Hello? Yoo-hoo! Can you see me?’\n\nShe tapped her shoulder. That seemed to do it.\n\nMrs Elm’s face broke out in massive relief as she turned away from the computer. ‘Oh Nora, you got here?’\n\n‘Were you expecting me not to? Did you think that life would be the one I wanted to live?’\n\nShe shook her head without really moving it. If that was possible. ‘No. It’s not that. It’s just that it looked fragile.’\n\n‘What looked fragile?’\n\n‘The transfer.’\n\n‘Transfer?’\n\n‘From the book to here. The life you chose to here. It seems there is a problem. A problem with the whole system. Something beyond my immediate control. Something external.’\n\n‘You mean, in my actual life?’\n\nShe stared back at the screen. ‘Yes. You see, the Midnight Library only exists because you do. In your root life.’\n\n‘So, I’m dying?’\n\nMrs Elm looked exasperated. ‘It’s a possibility. That is to say, it’s a possibility that we are reaching the end of possibility.’\n\nNora thought of how good it had felt, swimming in the pool. How vital and alive. And then something happened inside her. A strange feeling. A pull in her stomach. A physical shift. A change in her. The idea of death suddenly troubled her. At that same time the lights stopped flickering overhead and shone brightly.\n\nMrs Elm clapped her hands as she absorbed new information on the computer screen.\n\n‘Oh, it’s back. That’s good. The glitch is gone. We are running again. Thanks, I believe, to you.’\n\n‘What?’\n\n‘Well, the computer says the root cause within the host has been temporarily fixed. And you are the root cause. You are the host.’ She smiled. Nora blinked, and when she opened her eyes both she and Mrs Elm were standing in a different part of the library. Between stacks of bookshelves again. Standing, stiffly, awkwardly, facing each other.\n\n‘Right. Now, settle,’ said Mrs Elm, before releasing a deep and meaningful exhale. She was clearly talking to herself.\n\n‘My mum died on different dates in different lives. I’d like a life where she is still here. Does that life exist?’\n\nMrs Elm’s attention switched to Nora.\n\n‘Maybe it does.’\n\n‘Great.’\n\n‘But you can’t get there.’\n\n‘Why not?’\n\n‘Because this library is about your decisions. There was no choice you could have made that led to her being alive beyond yesterday. I’m sorry.’\n\nA light bulb flickered above Nora’s head. But the rest of the library stayed as it was.\n\n‘You need to think about something else, Nora. What was good about the last life?’\n\nNora nodded. ‘Swimming. I liked swimming. But I don’t think I was happy in that life. I don’t know if I am truly happy in any life.’\n\n‘Is happiness the aim?’\n\n‘I don’t know. I suppose I want my life to mean something. I want to do something good.’\n\n‘You once wanted to be a glaciologist,’ Mrs Elm appeared to remember.\n\n‘Yeah.’\n\n‘You used to talk about it. You said you were interested in the Arctic, so I suggested you become a glaciologist.’\n\n‘I remember. I liked the sound of it straight away. My mum and dad never liked the idea, though.’\n\n‘Why?’\n\n‘I don’t really know. They encouraged swimming. Well, Dad did. But anything that involved academic work, they were funny about.’\n\nNora felt a deep sadness, down in her stomach. From her arrival into life, she was considered by her parents in a different way to her brother.\n\n‘Other than swimming, Joe was the one expected to pursue things,’ she told Mrs Elm. ‘My mum put me off anything that could take me away. Unlike Dad, she didn’t even push me to swim. But surely there must be a life where I didn’t listen to my mum and where I am now an Arctic researcher. Far away from everything. With a purpose. Helping the planet. Researching the impact of climate change. On the front line.’\n\n‘So, you want me to find that life for you?’\n\nNora sighed. She still had no idea what she wanted. But at least the Arctic Circle would be different.\n\n‘All right. Yes.’"}]}
